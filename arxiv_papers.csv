Automated radiotherapy treatment planning guided by GPT-4Vision,"Sheng Liu, Oscar Pastor-Serrano, Yizheng Chen, Matthew Gopaulchan, Weixing Liang, Mark Buyyounouski, Erqi Pollom, Quynh-Thu Le, Michael Gensheimer, Peng Dong, Yong Yang, James Zou, Lei Xing",2024-06-21,"Radiotherapy treatment planning is a time-consuming and potentially subjective process that requires the iterative adjustment of model parameters to balance multiple conflicting objectives. Recent advancements in large foundation models offer promising avenues for addressing the challenges in planning and clinical decision-making. This study introduces GPT-RadPlan, a fully automated treatment planning framework that harnesses prior radiation oncology knowledge encoded in multi-modal large language models, such as GPT-4Vision (GPT-4V) from OpenAI. GPT-RadPlan is made aware of planning protocols as context and acts as an expert human planner, capable of guiding a treatment planning process. Via in-context learning, we incorporate clinical protocols for various disease sites as prompts to enable GPT-4V to acquire treatment planning domain knowledge. The resulting GPT-RadPlan agent is integrated into our in-house inverse treatment planning system through an API. The efficacy of the automated planning system is showcased using multiple prostate and head & neck cancer cases, where we compared GPT-RadPlan results to clinical plans. In all cases, GPT-RadPlan either outperformed or matched the clinical plans, demonstrating superior target coverage and organ-at-risk sparing. Consistently satisfying the dosimetric objectives in the clinical protocol, GPT-RadPlan represents the first multimodal large language model agent that mimics the behaviors of human planners in radiation oncology clinics, achieving remarkable results in automating the treatment planning process without the need for additional training.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15609v2
The Case for Developing a Foundation Model for Planning-like Tasks from Scratch,"Biplav Srivastava, Vishal Pallagani",2024-04-06,"Foundation Models (FMs) have revolutionized many areas of computing, including Automated Planning and Scheduling (APS). For example, a recent study found them useful for planning problems: plan generation, language translation, model construction, multi-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool integration, and brain-inspired planning. Besides APS, there are many seemingly related tasks involving the generation of a series of actions with varying guarantees of their executability to achieve intended goals, which we collectively call planning-like (PL) tasks like business processes, programs, workflows, and guidelines, where researchers have considered using FMs. However, previous works have primarily focused on pre-trained, off-the-shelf FMs and optionally fine-tuned them. This paper discusses the need for a comprehensive FM for PL tasks from scratch and explores its design considerations. We argue that such an FM will open new and efficient avenues for PL problem-solving, just like LLMs are creating for APS.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04540v1
On the Prospects of Incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Planning and Scheduling (APS),"Vishal Pallagani, Kaushik Roy, Bharath Muppasani, Francesco Fabiano, Andrea Loreggia, Keerthiram Murugesan, Biplav Srivastava, Francesca Rossi, Lior Horesh, Amit Sheth",2024-01-04,"Automated Planning and Scheduling is among the growing areas in Artificial Intelligence (AI) where mention of LLMs has gained popularity. Based on a comprehensive review of 126 papers, this paper investigates eight categories based on the unique applications of LLMs in addressing various aspects of planning problems: language translation, plan generation, model construction, multi-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool integration, and brain-inspired planning. For each category, we articulate the issues considered and existing gaps. A critical insight resulting from our review is that the true potential of LLMs unfolds when they are integrated with traditional symbolic planners, pointing towards a promising neuro-symbolic approach. This approach effectively combines the generative aspects of LLMs with the precision of classical planning methods. By synthesizing insights from existing literature, we underline the potential of this integration to address complex planning challenges. Our goal is to encourage the ICAPS community to recognize the complementary strengths of LLMs and symbolic planners, advocating for a direction in automated planning that leverages these synergistic capabilities to develop more advanced and intelligent planning systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02500v2
Can LLMs Fix Issues with Reasoning Models? Towards More Likely Models for AI Planning,"Turgay Caglar, Sirine Belhaj, Tathagata Chakraborti, Michael Katz, Sarath Sreedharan",2023-11-22,"This is the first work to look at the application of large language models (LLMs) for the purpose of model space edits in automated planning tasks. To set the stage for this union, we explore two different flavors of model space problems that have been studied in the AI planning literature and explore the effect of an LLM on those tasks. We empirically demonstrate how the performance of an LLM contrasts with combinatorial search (CS) -- an approach that has been traditionally used to solve model space tasks in planning, both with the LLM in the role of a standalone model space reasoner as well as in the role of a statistical signal in concert with the CS approach as part of a two-stage process. Our experiments show promising results suggesting further forays of LLMs into the exciting world of model space reasoning for planning tasks in the future.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13720v2
Understanding the Capabilities of Large Language Models for Automated Planning,"Vishal Pallagani, Bharath Muppasani, Keerthiram Murugesan, Francesca Rossi, Biplav Srivastava, Lior Horesh, Francesco Fabiano, Andrea Loreggia",2023-05-25,"Automated planning is concerned with developing efficient algorithms to generate plans or sequences of actions to achieve a specific goal in a given environment. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer questions, write high-quality programming code, and predict protein folding, showcasing their versatility in solving various tasks beyond language-based problems. In this paper, we aim to explore how LLMs can also be used for automated planning. To do so, we seek to answer four key questions. Firstly, we want to understand the extent to which LLMs can be used for plan generation. Secondly, we aim to identify which pre-training data is most effective in facilitating plan generation. Thirdly, we investigate whether fine-tuning or prompting is a more effective approach for plan generation. Finally, we explore whether LLMs are capable of plan generalization. By answering these questions, the study seeks to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in solving complex planning problems and provide insights into the most effective approaches for using LLMs in this context.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16151v1
Plansformer: Generating Symbolic Plans using Transformers,"Vishal Pallagani, Bharath Muppasani, Keerthiram Murugesan, Francesca Rossi, Lior Horesh, Biplav Srivastava, Francesco Fabiano, Andrea Loreggia",2022-12-16,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been the subject of active research, significantly advancing the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). From BERT to BLOOM, LLMs have surpassed state-of-the-art results in various natural language tasks such as question answering, summarization, and text generation. Many ongoing efforts focus on understanding LLMs' capabilities, including their knowledge of the world, syntax, and semantics. However, extending the textual prowess of LLMs to symbolic reasoning has been slow and predominantly focused on tackling problems related to the mathematical field. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automated planning - a branch of AI concerned with the realization of action sequences (plans) to achieve a goal, typically executed by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, and unmanned vehicles. We introduce Plansformer; an LLM fine-tuned on planning problems and capable of generating plans with favorable behavior in terms of correctness and length with reduced knowledge-engineering efforts. We also demonstrate the adaptability of Plansformer in solving different planning domains with varying complexities, owing to the transfer learning abilities of LLMs. For one configuration of Plansformer, we achieve ~97% valid plans, out of which ~95% are optimal for Towers of Hanoi - a puzzle-solving domain.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08681v1
PlanBench: An Extensible Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Planning and Reasoning about Change,"Karthik Valmeekam, Matthew Marquez, Alberto Olmo, Sarath Sreedharan, Subbarao Kambhampati",2022-06-21,"Generating plans of action, and reasoning about change have long been considered a core competence of intelligent agents. It is thus no surprise that evaluating the planning and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) has become a hot topic of research. Most claims about LLM planning capabilities are however based on common sense tasks-where it becomes hard to tell whether LLMs are planning or merely retrieving from their vast world knowledge. There is a strong need for systematic and extensible planning benchmarks with sufficient diversity to evaluate whether LLMs have innate planning capabilities. Motivated by this, we propose PlanBench, an extensible benchmark suite based on the kinds of domains used in the automated planning community, especially in the International Planning Competition, to test the capabilities of LLMs in planning or reasoning about actions and change. PlanBench provides sufficient diversity in both the task domains and the specific planning capabilities. Our studies also show that on many critical capabilities-including plan generation-LLM performance falls quite short, even with the SOTA models. PlanBench can thus function as a useful marker of progress of LLMs in planning and reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10498v4
Language-Augmented Symbolic Planner for Open-World Task Planning,"Guanqi Chen, Lei Yang, Ruixing Jia, Zhe Hu, Yizhou Chen, Wei Zhang, Wenping Wang, Jia Pan",2024-07-13,"Enabling robotic agents to perform complex long-horizon tasks has been a long-standing goal in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the potential shown by large language models (LLMs), their planning capabilities remain limited to short-horizon tasks and they are unable to replace the symbolic planning approach. Symbolic planners, on the other hand, may encounter execution errors due to their common assumption of complete domain knowledge which is hard to manually prepare for an open-world setting. In this paper, we introduce a Language-Augmented Symbolic Planner (LASP) that integrates pre-trained LLMs to enable conventional symbolic planners to operate in an open-world environment where only incomplete knowledge of action preconditions, objects, and properties is initially available. In case of execution errors, LASP can utilize the LLM to diagnose the cause of the error based on the observation and interact with the environment to incrementally build up its knowledge base necessary for accomplishing the given tasks. Experiments demonstrate that LASP is proficient in solving planning problems in the open-world setting, performing well even in situations where there are multiple gaps in the knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09792v1
AutoGPT+P: Affordance-based Task Planning with Large Language Models,"Timo Birr, Christoph Pohl, Abdelrahman Younes, Tamim Asfour",2024-02-16,"Recent advances in task planning leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve generalizability by combining such models with classical planning algorithms to address their inherent limitations in reasoning capabilities. However, these approaches face the challenge of dynamically capturing the initial state of the task planning problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose AutoGPT+P, a system that combines an affordance-based scene representation with a planning system. Affordances encompass the action possibilities of an agent on the environment and objects present in it. Thus, deriving the planning domain from an affordance-based scene representation allows symbolic planning with arbitrary objects. AutoGPT+P leverages this representation to derive and execute a plan for a task specified by the user in natural language. In addition to solving planning tasks under a closed-world assumption, AutoGPT+P can also handle planning with incomplete information, e. g., tasks with missing objects by exploring the scene, suggesting alternatives, or providing a partial plan. The affordance-based scene representation combines object detection with an automatically generated object-affordance-mapping using ChatGPT. The core planning tool extends existing work by automatically correcting semantic and syntactic errors. Our approach achieves a success rate of 98%, surpassing the current 81% success rate of the current state-of-the-art LLM-based planning method SayCan on the SayCan instruction set. Furthermore, we evaluated our approach on our newly created dataset with 150 scenarios covering a wide range of complex tasks with missing objects, achieving a success rate of 79% on our dataset. The dataset and the code are publicly available at https://git.h2t.iar.kit.edu/birr/autogpt-p-standalone.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10778v2
Symbolic Planning and Code Generation for Grounded Dialogue,"Justin T. Chiu, Wenting Zhao, Derek Chen, Saujas Vaduguru, Alexander M. Rush, Daniel Fried",2023-10-26,"Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing and generating both text and code. However, LLMs have had limited applicability in grounded task-oriented dialogue as they are difficult to steer toward task objectives and fail to handle novel grounding. We present a modular and interpretable grounded dialogue system that addresses these shortcomings by composing LLMs with a symbolic planner and grounded code execution. Our system consists of a reader and planner: the reader leverages an LLM to convert partner utterances into executable code, calling functions that perform grounding. The translated code's output is stored to track dialogue state, while a symbolic planner determines the next appropriate response. We evaluate our system's performance on the demanding OneCommon dialogue task, involving collaborative reference resolution on abstract images of scattered dots. Our system substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, including improving task success in human evaluations from 56% to 69% in the most challenging setting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17140v1
Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning,"Anurag Ajay, Seungwook Han, Yilun Du, Shuang Li, Abhi Gupta, Tommi Jaakkola, Josh Tenenbaum, Leslie Kaelbling, Akash Srivastava, Pulkit Agrawal",2023-09-15,"To make effective decisions in novel environments with long-horizon goals, it is crucial to engage in hierarchical reasoning across spatial and temporal scales. This entails planning abstract subgoal sequences, visually reasoning about the underlying plans, and executing actions in accordance with the devised plan through visual-motor control. We propose Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning (HiP), a foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks. We use a large language model to construct symbolic plans that are grounded in the environment through a large video diffusion model. Generated video plans are then grounded to visual-motor control, through an inverse dynamics model that infers actions from generated videos. To enable effective reasoning within this hierarchy, we enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement. We illustrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach in three different long-horizon table-top manipulation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08587v2
Egocentric Planning for Scalable Embodied Task Achievement,"Xiaotian Liu, Hector Palacios, Christian Muise",2023-06-02,"Embodied agents face significant challenges when tasked with performing actions in diverse environments, particularly in generalizing across object types and executing suitable actions to accomplish tasks. Furthermore, agents should exhibit robustness, minimizing the execution of illegal actions. In this work, we present Egocentric Planning, an innovative approach that combines symbolic planning and Object-oriented POMDPs to solve tasks in complex environments, harnessing existing models for visual perception and natural language processing. We evaluated our approach in ALFRED, a simulated environment designed for domestic tasks, and demonstrated its high scalability, achieving an impressive 36.07% unseen success rate in the ALFRED benchmark and winning the ALFRED challenge at CVPR Embodied AI workshop. Our method requires reliable perception and the specification or learning of a symbolic description of the preconditions and effects of the agent's actions, as well as what object types reveal information about others. It is capable of naturally scaling to solve new tasks beyond ALFRED, as long as they can be solved using the available skills. This work offers a solid baseline for studying end-to-end and hybrid methods that aim to generalize to new tasks, including recent approaches relying on LLMs, but often struggle to scale to long sequences of actions or produce robust plans for novel tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01295v1
Chain-of-Symbol Prompting Elicits Planning in Large Langauge Models,"Hanxu Hu, Hongyuan Lu, Huajian Zhang, Yun-Ze Song, Wai Lam, Yue Zhang",2023-05-17,"In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the performance of LLMs on complex planning tasks that require LLMs to understand a virtual spatial environment simulated via natural language and act correspondingly in text. We propose a benchmark named Natural Language Planning and Action (Natala) composed of a set of novel tasks: Brick World, NLVR-based Manipulations, and Natural Language Navigation. We found that current popular LLMs such as ChatGPT still lack abilities in complex planning. This arises a question -- do the LLMs have a good understanding of the environments described in natural language, or maybe other alternatives such as symbolic representations are neater and hence better to be understood by LLMs? To this end, we propose a novel method called CoS (Chain-of-Symbol Prompting) that represents the complex environments with condensed symbolic spatial representations during the chained intermediate thinking steps. CoS is easy to use and does not need additional training on LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that CoS clearly surpasses the performance of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting in all three planning tasks with even fewer tokens used in the inputs compared with CoT on ChatGPT and InstructGPT. The performance gain is strong, by up to 60.8% accuracy (from 31.8% to 92.6%) on Brick World for ChatGPT. CoS also reduces the number of tokens in the prompt obviously, by up to 65.8% of the tokens (from 407 to 139) for the intermediate steps from demonstrations on Brick World.

Learning to Reason over Scene Graphs: A Case Study of Finetuning GPT-2 into a Robot Language Model for Grounded Task Planning,"Georgia Chalvatzaki, Ali Younes, Daljeet Nandha, An Le, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Iryna Gurevych",2023-05-12,"Long-horizon task planning is essential for the development of intelligent assistive and service robots. In this work, we investigate the applicability of a smaller class of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-2, in robotic task planning by learning to decompose tasks into subgoal specifications for a planner to execute sequentially. Our method grounds the input of the LLM on the domain that is represented as a scene graph, enabling it to translate human requests into executable robot plans, thereby learning to reason over long-horizon tasks, as encountered in the ALFRED benchmark. We compare our approach with classical planning and baseline methods to examine the applicability and generalizability of LLM-based planners. Our findings suggest that the knowledge stored in an LLM can be effectively grounded to perform long-horizon task planning, demonstrating the promising potential for the future application of neuro-symbolic planning methods in robotics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07716v1

Negotiating Control: Neurosymbolic Variable Autonomy,"Georgios Bakirtzis, Manolis Chiou, Andreas Theodorou",2024-07-23,"Variable autonomy equips a system, such as a robot, with mixed initiatives such that it can adjust its independence level based on the task's complexity and the surrounding environment. Variable autonomy solves two main problems in robotic planning: the first is the problem of humans being unable to keep focus in monitoring and intervening during robotic tasks without appropriate human factor indicators, and the second is achieving mission success in unforeseen and uncertain environments in the face of static reward structures. An open problem in variable autonomy is developing robust methods to dynamically balance autonomy and human intervention in real-time, ensuring optimal performance and safety in unpredictable and evolving environments. We posit that addressing unpredictable and evolving environments through an addition of rule-based symbolic logic has the potential to make autonomy adjustments more contextually reliable and adding feedback to reinforcement learning through data from mixed-initiative control further increases efficacy and safety of autonomous behaviour.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16254v1
Revolutionizing Battery Disassembly: The Design and Implementation of a Battery Disassembly Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(BEAM-1),"Yanlong Peng, Zhigang Wang, Yisheng Zhang, Shengmin Zhang, Nan Cai, Fan Wu, Ming Chen",2024-07-09,"The efficient disassembly of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries(EOL-EVBs) is crucial for green manufacturing and sustainable development. The current pre-programmed disassembly conducted by the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(AMMR) struggles to meet the disassembly requirements in dynamic environments, complex scenarios, and unstructured processes. In this paper, we propose a Battery Disassembly AMMR(BEAM-1) system based on NeuralSymbolic AI. It detects the environmental state by leveraging a combination of multi-sensors and neural predicates and then translates this information into a quasi-symbolic space. In real-time, it identifies the optimal sequence of action primitives through LLM-heuristic tree search, ensuring high-precision execution of these primitives. Additionally, it employs positional speculative sampling using intuitive networks and achieves the disassembly of various bolt types with a meticulously designed end-effector. Importantly, BEAM-1 is a continuously learning embodied intelligence system capable of subjective reasoning like a human, and possessing intuition. A large number of real scene experiments have proved that it can autonomously perceive, decide, and execute to complete the continuous disassembly of bolts in multiple, multi-category, and complex situations, with a success rate of 98.78%. This research attempts to use NeuroSymbolic AI to give robots real autonomous reasoning, planning, and learning capabilities. BEAM-1 realizes the revolution of battery disassembly. Its framework can be easily ported to any robotic system to realize different application scenarios, which provides a ground-breaking idea for the design and implementation of future embodied intelligent robotic systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06590v1
Symbiotic Game and Foundation Models for Cyber Deception Operations in Strategic Cyber Warfare,"Tao Li, Quanyan Zhu",2024-03-14,"We are currently facing unprecedented cyber warfare with the rapid evolution of tactics, increasing asymmetry of intelligence, and the growing accessibility of hacking tools. In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation.

Compared to traditional learning methods, Neurosymbolic AI offers significant advantages by simplifying complexity and providing transparency and explainability. Reinforcement Learning(RL), a long-standing Artificial Intelligence(AI) concept that mimics human behavior using rewards and punishment, is a fundamental component of Neurosymbolic RL, a recent integration of the two fields that has yielded promising results. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the emerging field of Neurosymbolic RL by conducting a literature survey. Our evaluation focuses on the three components that constitute Neurosymbolic RL: neural, symbolic, and RL. We categorize works based on the role played by the neural and symbolic parts in RL, into three taxonomies:Learning for Reasoning, Reasoning for Learning and Learning-Reasoning.

"Neurosymbolic AI -- Why, What, and How","Amit Sheth, Kaushik Roy, Manas Gaur",2023-05-01,"Humans interact with the environment using a combination of perception - transforming sensory inputs from their environment into symbols, and cognition - mapping symbols to knowledge about the environment for supporting abstraction, reasoning by analogy, and long-term planning. Human perception-inspired machine perception, in the context of AI, refers to large-scale pattern recognition from raw data using neural networks trained using self-supervised learning objectives such as next-word prediction or object recognition. On the other hand, machine cognition encompasses more complex computations, such as using knowledge of the environment to guide reasoning, analogy, and long-term planning. Humans can also control and explain their cognitive functions. This seems to require the retention of symbolic mappings from perception outputs to knowledge about their environment. For example, humans can follow and explain the guidelines and safety constraints driving their decision-making in safety-critical applications such as healthcare, criminal justice, and autonomous driving. This article introduces the rapidly emerging paradigm of Neurosymbolic AI combines neural networks and knowledge-guided symbolic approaches to create more capable and flexible AI systems. These systems have immense potential to advance both algorithm-level (e.g., abstraction, analogy, reasoning) and application-level (e.g., explainable and safety-constrained decision-making) capabilities of AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00813v1

A Framework for Neurosymbolic Robot Action Planning using Large Language Models,"Alessio Capitanelli, Fulvio Mastrogiovanni",2023-03-01,"Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy due to its ease of understanding and deployment in robot architectures. However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in real-world, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance in complex planning domains or when frequent re-planning is needed. We present a framework, Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs' response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the output, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of end-to-end, making each action available for execution as soon as it is generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn enables concurrent planning and execution. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted by the research community to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to provide an overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities to build a look-ahead predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000 samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by up to 61.4%",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00438v3

Neurosymbolic Motion and Task Planning for Linear Temporal Logic Tasks,"Xiaowu Sun, Yasser Shoukry",2022-10-11,"This paper presents a neurosymbolic framework to solve motion planning problems for mobile robots involving temporal goals. The temporal goals are described using temporal logic formulas such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to capture complex tasks. The proposed framework trains Neural Network (NN)-based planners that enjoy strong correctness guarantees when applying to unseen tasks, i.e., the exact task (including workspace, LTL formula, and dynamic constraints of a robot) is unknown during the training of NNs. Our approach to achieving theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency is based on two insights. First, we incorporate a symbolic model into the training of NNs such that the resulting NN-based planner inherits the interpretability and correctness guarantees of the symbolic model. Moreover, the symbolic model serves as a discrete ""memory"", which is necessary for satisfying temporal logic formulas. Second, we train a library of neural networks offline and combine a subset of the trained NNs into a single NN-based planner at runtime when a task is revealed. In particular, we develop a novel constrained NN training procedure, named formal NN training, to enforce that each neural network in the library represents a ""symbol"" in the symbolic model. As a result, our neurosymbolic framework enjoys the scalability and flexibility benefits of machine learning and inherits the provable guarantees from control-theoretic and formal-methods techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulations and on an actual robotic vehicle, and show that our framework can generalize to unknown tasks where state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning techniques fail.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05180v1
Learning Symbolic Operators: A Neurosymbolic Solution for Autonomous Disassembly of Electric Vehicle Battery,"Yidong Du, Wenshuo Wang, Zhigang Wang, Hua Yang, Haitao Wang, Yinghao Cai, Ming Chen",2022-06-07,"The booming of electric vehicles demands efficient battery disassembly for recycling to be environment-friendly. Currently, battery disassembly is still primarily done by humans, probably assisted by robots, due to the unstructured environment and high uncertainties. It is highly desirable to design autonomous solutions to improve work efficiency and lower human risks in high voltage and toxic environments. This paper proposes a novel neurosymbolic method, which augments the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model to learn symbolic operators based on raw sensory inputs and their relationships.

Neurosymbolic Transformers for Multi-Agent Communication,"Jeevana Priya Inala, Yichen Yang, James Paulos, Yewen Pu, Osbert Bastani, Vijay Kumar, Martin Rinard, Armando Solar-Lezama",2021-01-05,"We study the problem of inferring communication structures that can solve cooperative multi-agent planning problems while minimizing the amount of communication. We quantify the amount of communication as the maximum degree of the communication graph; this metric captures settings where agents have limited bandwidth. Minimizing communication is challenging due to the combinatorial nature of both the decision space and the objective; for instance, we cannot solve this problem by training neural networks using gradient descent. We propose a novel algorithm that synthesizes a control policy that combines a programmatic communication policy used to generate the communication graph with a transformer policy network used to choose actions. Our algorithm first trains the transformer policy, which implicitly generates a ""soft"" communication graph; then, it synthesizes a programmatic communication policy that ""hardens"" this graph, forming a neurosymbolic transformer. Our experiments demonstrate how our approach can synthesize policies that generate low-degree communication graphs while maintaining near-optimal performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03238v1
Language-Augmented Symbolic Planner for Open-World Task Planning,"Guanqi Chen, Lei Yang, Ruixing Jia, Zhe Hu, Yizhou Chen, Wei Zhang, Wenping Wang, Jia Pan",2024-07-13,"Enabling robotic agents to perform complex long-horizon tasks has been a long-standing goal in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the potential shown by large language models (LLMs), their planning capabilities remain limited to short-horizon tasks and they are unable to replace the symbolic planning approach. Symbolic planners, on the other hand, may encounter execution errors due to their common assumption of complete domain knowledge which is hard to manually prepare for an open-world setting. In this paper, we introduce a Language-Augmented Symbolic Planner (LASP) that integrates pre-trained LLMs to enable conventional symbolic planners to operate in an open-world environment where only incomplete knowledge of action preconditions, objects, and properties is initially available. In case of execution errors, LASP can utilize the LLM to diagnose the cause of the error based on the observation and interact with the environment to incrementally build up its knowledge base necessary for accomplishing the given tasks. Experiments demonstrate that LASP is proficient in solving planning problems in the open-world setting, performing well even in situations where there are multiple gaps in the knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09792v1

The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their exceptional abilities in solving complex mathematical problems, mastering commonsense and abstract reasoning. This has led to the recent utilization of MLLMs as the brain in robotic systems, enabling these models to conduct high-level planning prior to triggering low-level control actions for task execution. However, it remains uncertain whether existing MLLMs are reliable in serving the brain role of robots.

Human-Object Interaction from Human-Level Instructions,"Zhen Wu, Jiaman Li, C. Karen Liu",2024-06-25,"Intelligent agents need to autonomously navigate and interact within contextual environments to perform a wide range of daily tasks based on human-level instructions. These agents require a foundational understanding of the world, incorporating common sense and knowledge, to interpret such instructions. Moreover, they must possess precise low-level skills for movement and interaction to execute the detailed task plans derived from these instructions. In this work, we address the task of synthesizing continuous human-object interactions for manipulating large objects within contextual environments, guided by human-level instructions. Our goal is to generate synchronized object motion, full-body human motion, and detailed finger motion, all essential for realistic interactions. Our framework consists of a large language model (LLM) planning module and a low-level motion generator. We use LLMs to deduce spatial object relationships and devise a method for accurately determining their positions and orientations in target scene layouts. Additionally, the LLM planner outlines a detailed task plan specifying a sequence of sub-tasks. This task plan, along with the target object poses, serves as input for our low-level motion generator, which seamlessly alternates between navigation and interaction modules. We present the first complete system that can synthesize object motion, full-body motion, and finger motion simultaneously from human-level instructions.

Embodied Instruction Following in Unknown Environments,"Zhenyu Wu, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Jiwen Lu, Haibin Yan",2024-06-17,"Enabling embodied agents to complete complex human instructions from natural language is crucial to autonomous systems in household services. Conventional methods can only accomplish human instructions in the known environment where all interactive objects are provided to the embodied agent, and directly deploying the existing approaches for the unknown environment usually generates infeasible plans that manipulate non-existing objects. On the contrary, we propose an embodied instruction following (EIF) method for complex tasks in the unknown environment, where the agent efficiently explores the unknown environment to generate feasible plans with existing objects to accomplish abstract instructions. Specifically, we build a hierarchical embodied instruction following framework including the high-level task planner and the low-level exploration controller with multimodal large language models. We then construct a semantic representation map of the scene with dynamic region attention to demonstrate the known visual clues, where the goal of task planning and scene exploration is aligned for human instruction. For the task planner, we generate the feasible step-by-step plans for human goal accomplishment according to the task completion process and the known visual clues. For the exploration controller, the optimal navigation or object interaction policy is predicted based on the generated step-wise plans and the known visual clues.

Details Make a Difference: Object State-Sensitive Neurorobotic Task Planning,"Xiaowen Sun, Xufeng Zhao, Jae Hee Lee, Wenhao Lu, Matthias Kerzel, Stefan Wermter",2024-06-14,"The state of an object reflects its current status or condition and is important for a robot's task planning and manipulation. However, detecting an object's state and generating a state-sensitive plan for robots is challenging. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or VLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we introduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent empowered by pre-trained neural networks. We propose two methods for OSSA: (i) a modular model consisting of a pre-trained vision processing module (dense captioning model, DCM) and a natural language processing model (LLM), and (ii) a monolithic model consisting only of a VLM. To quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to clear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object states into consideration. Our results show that both methods can be used for object state-sensitive tasks, but the monolithic approach outperforms the modular approach.

Existing methods for enhancing the safety of LLMs are not directly transferable to LLM-powered agents due to their diverse objectives and output modalities. In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first LLM agent as a guardrail to other LLM agents. Specifically, GuardAgent oversees a target LLM agent by checking whether its inputs/outputs satisfy a set of given guard requests defined by the users. GuardAgent comprises two steps: 1) creating a task plan by analyzing the provided guard requests, and 2) generating guardrail code based on the task plan and executing the code by calling APIs or using external engines. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the core reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module. Such knowledge-enabled reasoning allows GuardAgent to understand various textual guard requests and accurately ""translate"" them into executable code that provides reliable guardrails. Furthermore, GuardAgent is equipped with an extendable toolbox containing functions and APIs and requires no additional LLM training, which underscores its generalization capabilities and low operational overhead. Additionally, we propose two novel benchmarks: an EICU-AC benchmark for assessing privacy-related access control for healthcare agents and a Mind2Web-SC benchmark for safety evaluation for web agents. We show the effectiveness of GuardAgent on these two benchmarks with 98.7% and 90.0% accuracy in moderating invalid inputs and outputs for the two types of agents, respectively.

CLMASP initiates with a LLM generating a basic skeleton plan, which is subsequently tailored to the specific scenario using a vector database. This plan is then refined by an ASP program with a robot's action knowledge, which integrates implementation details into the skeleton, grounding the LLM's abstract outputs in practical robot contexts.

Task Planning for Object Rearrangement in Multi-room Environments,"Karan Mirakhor, Sourav Ghosh, Dipanjan Das, Brojeshwar Bhowmick",2024-06-01,"Object rearrangement in a multi-room setup should produce a reasonable plan that reduces the agent's overall travel and the number of steps. Recent state-of-the-art methods fail to produce such plans because they rely on explicit exploration for discovering unseen objects due to partial observability and a heuristic planner to sequence the actions for rearrangement. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task planner to efficiently plan a sequence of actions to discover unseen objects and rearrange misplaced objects within an untidy house to achieve a desired tidy state. The proposed method introduces several novel techniques, including (i) a method for discovering unseen objects using commonsense knowledge from large language models, (ii) a collision resolution and buffer prediction method based on Cross-Entropy Method to handle blocked goal and swap cases, (iii) a directed spatial graph-based state space for scalability, and (iv) deep reinforcement learning (RL) for producing an efficient planner. The planner interleaves the discovery of unseen objects and rearrangement to minimize the number of steps taken and overall traversal of the agent.

From Words to Actions: Unveiling the Theoretical Underpinnings of LLM-Driven Autonomous Systems,"Jianliang He, Siyu Chen, Fengzhuo Zhang, Zhuoran Yang",2024-05-30,"In this work, from a theoretical lens, we aim to understand why large language model (LLM) empowered agents are able to solve decision-making problems in the physical world. To this end, consider a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) model where the LLM Planner and the Actor perform high-level task planning and low-level execution, respectively. Under this model, the LLM Planner navigates a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) by iteratively generating language-based subgoals via prompting. Under proper assumptions on the pretraining data, we prove that the pretrained LLM Planner effectively performs Bayesian aggregated imitation learning (BAIL) through in-context learning. Additionally, we highlight the necessity for exploration beyond the subgoals derived from BAIL by proving that naively executing the subgoals returned by LLM leads to a linear regret. As a remedy, we introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy to BAIL, which is proven to incur sublinear regret when the pretraining error is small. Finally, we extend our theoretical framework to include scenarios where the LLM Planner serves as a world model for inferring the transition model of the environment and to multi-agent settings, enabling coordination among multiple Actors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19883v2

It aims to break down complex user requests into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests. In this context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes represent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them. Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it. In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design. Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the biases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to effectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by graph neural networks (GNNs). This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs with LLMs to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and minimal training can further enhance their performance.

Long-horizon Locomotion and Manipulation on a Quadrupedal Robot with Large Language Models,"Yutao Ouyang, Jinhan Li, Yunfei Li, Zhongyu Li, Chao Yu, Koushil Sreenath, Yi Wu",2024-04-08,"We present a large language model (LLM) based system to empower quadrupedal robots with problem-solving abilities for long-horizon tasks beyond short-term motions. Long-horizon tasks for quadrupeds are challenging since they require both a high-level understanding of the semantics of the problem for task planning and a broad range of locomotion and manipulation skills to interact with the environment. Our system builds a high-level reasoning layer with large language models, which generates hybrid discrete-continuous plans as robot code from task descriptions. It comprises multiple LLM agents: a semantic planner for sketching a plan, a parameter calculator for predicting arguments in the plan, and a code generator to convert the plan into executable robot code. At the low level, we adopt reinforcement learning to train a set of motion planning and control skills to unleash the flexibility of quadrupeds for rich environment interactions. Our system is tested on long-horizon tasks that are infeasible to complete with one single skill.

VoicePilot: Harnessing LLMs as Speech Interfaces for Physically Assistive Robots,"Akhil Padmanabha, Jessie Yuan, Janavi Gupta, Zulekha Karachiwalla, Carmel Majidi, Henny Admoni, Zackory Erickson",2024-04-05,"Physically assistive robots present an opportunity to significantly increase the well-being and independence of individuals with motor impairments or other forms of disability who are unable to complete activities of daily living. Speech interfaces, especially ones that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs), can enable individuals to effectively and naturally communicate high-level commands and nuanced preferences to robots. Frameworks for integrating LLMs as interfaces to robots for high level task planning and code generation have been proposed, but fail to incorporate human-centric considerations which are essential while developing assistive interfaces.

Can only LLMs do Reasoning?: Potential of Small Language Models in Task Planning,"Gawon Choi, Hyemin Ahn",2024-04-05,"In robotics, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming prevalent, especially for understanding human commands. In particular, LLMs are utilized as domain-agnostic task planners for high-level human commands. LLMs are capable of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and this allows LLMs to be task planners. However, we need to consider that modern robots still struggle to perform complex actions, and the domains where robots can be deployed are limited in practice. This leads us to pose a question: If small LMs can be trained to reason in chains within a single domain, would even small LMs be good task planners for the robots? To train smaller LMs to reason in chains, we build `COmmand-STeps datasets' (COST) consisting of high-level commands along with corresponding actionable low-level steps, via LLMs. We release not only our datasets but also the prompt templates used to generate them, to allow anyone to build datasets for their domain. We compare GPT3.5 and GPT4 with the finetuned GPT2 for task domains, in tabletop and kitchen environments, and the result shows that GPT2-medium is comparable to GPT3.5 for task planning in a specific domain.

However, managing the vast knowledge encapsulated within these large models has posed challenges, often resulting in infeasible plans generated by LLM-based planning systems due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To overcome these challenges and obtain even greater planning feasibility and computational efficiency, we propose a novel LLM-driven task planning approach called DELTA. For achieving better grounding from environmental topology into actionable knowledge, DELTA leverages the power of scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, enabling the fast generation of precise planning problem descriptions. For obtaining higher planning performance, we use LLMs to decompose the long-term task goals into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals for an automated task planner to solve.

Enhancing the General Agent Capabilities of Low-Parameter LLMs through Tuning and Multi-Branch Reasoning,"Qinhao Zhou, Zihan Zhang, Xiang Xiang, Ke Wang, Yuchuan Wu, Yongbin Li",2024-03-29,"Open-source pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong language understanding and generation capabilities, making them highly successful in a variety of tasks.

Recent robotic task planning methods based on open-source LLMs typically leverage vast task planning datasets to enhance models' planning abilities.

This paper addresses this limitation by proposing MLDT, theMulti-Level Decomposition Task planning method. This method innovatively decomposes tasks at the goal-level, task-level, and action-level to mitigate the challenge of complex long-horizon tasks. In order to enhance open-source LLMs' planning abilities, we introduce a goal-sensitive corpus generation method to create high-quality training data and conduct instruction tuning on the generated corpus.

TwoStep: Multi-agent Task Planning using Classical Planners and Large Language Models,"Ishika Singh, David Traum, Jesse Thomason",2024-03-25,"Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, for example that two agents in the domain can execute an action simultaneously if postconditions of each do not interfere with preconditions of the other. A human expert can decompose a goal into largely independent constituent parts and assign each agent to one of these subgoals to take advantage of simultaneous actions for faster execution of plan steps, each using only single agent planning. By contrast, large language models (LLMs) used for directly inferring plan steps do not guarantee execution success, but do leverage commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. We combine the strengths of classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for two-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone and preserving execution success. Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of subgoals can achieve similar multi-agent execution steps than those specified by human experts.

AutoGPT+P: Affordance-based Task Planning with Large Language Models,"Timo Birr, Christoph Pohl, Abdelrahman Younes, Tamim Asfour",2024-02-16,"Recent advances in task planning leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve generalizability by combining such models with classical planning algorithms to address their inherent limitations in reasoning capabilities. However, these approaches face the challenge of dynamically capturing the initial state of the task planning problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose AutoGPT+P, a system that combines an affordance-based scene representation with a planning system. Affordances encompass the action possibilities of an agent on the environment and objects present in it. Thus, deriving the planning domain from an affordance-based scene representation allows symbolic planning with arbitrary objects. AutoGPT+P leverages this representation to derive and execute a plan for a task specified by the user in natural language. In addition to solving planning tasks under a closed-world assumption, AutoGPT+P can also handle planning with incomplete information, e. g., tasks with missing objects by exploring the scene, suggesting alternatives, or providing a partial plan. The affordance-based scene representation combines object detection with an automatically generated object-affordance-mapping using ChatGPT. The core planning tool extends existing work by automatically correcting semantic and syntactic errors.

Look Before You Leap: Unveiling the Power of GPT-4V in Robotic Vision-Language Planning,"Yingdong Hu, Fanqi Lin, Tong Zhang, Li Yi, Yang Gao",2023-11-29,"In this study, we are interested in imbuing robots with the capability of physically-grounded task planning. Recent advancements have shown that large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge useful in robotic tasks, especially in reasoning and planning. However, LLMs are constrained by their lack of world grounding and dependence on external affordance models to perceive environmental information, which cannot jointly reason with LLMs. We argue that a task planner should be an inherently grounded, unified multimodal system. To this end, we introduce Robotic Vision-Language Planning (ViLa), a novel approach for long-horizon robotic planning that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate a sequence of actionable steps. ViLa directly integrates perceptual data into its reasoning and planning process, enabling a profound understanding of commonsense knowledge in the visual world, including spatial layouts and object attributes.

To address the problem, we propose a RoboGPT agent\footnote{our code and dataset will be released soon} for making embodied long-term decisions for daily tasks, with two modules: 1) LLMs-based planning with re-plan to break the task into multiple sub-goals; 2) RoboSkill individually designed for sub-goals to learn better navigation and manipulation skills.

However, real-world complex systems present three prevalent challenges concerning task planning and tool usage: (1) The real system usually has a vast array of APIs, so it is impossible to feed the descriptions of all APIs to the prompt of LLMs as the token length is limited; (2) the real system is designed for handling complex tasks, and the base LLMs can hardly plan a correct sub-task order and API-calling order for such tasks; (3) Similar semantics and functionalities among APIs in real systems create challenges for both LLMs and even humans in distinguishing between them.

Distilling and Retrieving Generalizable Knowledge for Robot Manipulation via Language Corrections,"Lihan Zha, Yuchen Cui, Li-Heng Lin, Minae Kwon, Montserrat Gonzalez Arenas, Andy Zeng, Fei Xia, Dorsa Sadigh",2023-11-17,"Today's robot policies exhibit subpar performance when faced with the challenge of generalizing to novel environments. Human corrective feedback is a crucial form of guidance to enable such generalization. However, adapting to and learning from online human corrections is a non-trivial endeavor: not only do robots need to remember human feedback over time to retrieve the right information in new settings and reduce the intervention rate, but also they would need to be able to respond to feedback that can be arbitrary corrections about high-level human preferences to low-level adjustments to skill parameters. In this work, we present Distillation and Retrieval of Online Corrections (DROC), a large language model (LLM)-based system that can respond to arbitrary forms of language feedback, distill generalizable knowledge from corrections, and retrieve relevant past experiences based on textual and visual similarity for improving performance in novel settings. DROC is able to respond to a sequence of online language corrections that address failures in both high-level task plans and low-level skill primitives. We demonstrate that DROC effectively distills the relevant information from the sequence of online corrections in a knowledge base and retrieves that knowledge in settings with new task or object instances. DROC outperforms other techniques that directly generate robot code via LLMs by using only half of the total number of corrections needed in the first round and requires little to no corrections after two iterations.

Recent efforts focus on imitation learning from demonstrations or reinforcement learning in simulation, however, due to the prohibitive costs of real-world data collection and precise object simulation, it still remains challenging for these works to achieve broad adaptability across diverse articulated objects. Recently, many works have tried to utilize the strong in-context learning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve generalizable robotic manipulation, but most of these researches focus on high-level task planning, sidelining low-level robotic control. In this work, building on the idea that the kinematic structure of the object determines how we can manipulate it, we propose a kinematic-aware prompting framework that prompts LLMs with kinematic knowledge of objects to generate low-level motion trajectory waypoints, supporting various object manipulation. To effectively prompt LLMs with the kinematic structure of different objects, we design a unified kinematic knowledge parser, which represents various articulated objects as a unified textual description containing kinematic joints and contact location. Building upon this unified description, a kinematic-aware planner model is proposed to generate precise 3D manipulation waypoints via a designed kinematic-aware chain-of-thoughts prompting method. Our evaluation spanned 48 instances across 16 distinct categories, revealing that our framework not only outperforms traditional methods on 8 seen categories but also shows a powerful zero-shot capability for 8 unseen articulated object categories.

Graule, Volkan Isler",2023-10-30,"A robot in a human-centric environment needs to account for the human's intent and future motion in its task and motion planning to ensure safe and effective operation. This requires symbolic reasoning about probable future actions and the ability to tie these actions to specific locations in the physical environment. While one can train behavioral models capable of predicting human motion from past activities, this approach requires large amounts of data to achieve acceptable long-horizon predictions. More importantly, the resulting models are constrained to specific data formats and modalities. Moreover, connecting predictions from such models to the environment at hand to ensure the applicability of these predictions is an unsolved problem. We present a system that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to infer a human's next actions from a range of modalities without fine-tuning. A novel aspect of our system that is critical to robotics applications is that it links the predicted actions to specific locations in a semantic map of the environment. Our method leverages the fact that LLMs, trained on a vast corpus of text describing typical human behaviors, encode substantial world knowledge, including probable sequences of human actions and activities.

In this approach, a multi-round feedback-revision mechanism is utilized to encourage LLMs to actively select appropriate revision actions guided by feedback information from the environment. This facilitates exploration and enhances the model's performance. Besides, we integrate sub-task relabeling to assist LLMs in maintaining consistency in sub-task planning and help the model learn the combinatorial nature between tasks, enabling it to complete a wider range of tasks through training based on the acquired exploration experiences.

Tree-Planner: Efficient Close-loop Task Planning with Large Language Models,"Mengkang Hu, Yao Mu, Xinmiao Yu, Mingyu Ding, Shiguang Wu, Wenqi Shao, Qiguang Chen, Bin Wang, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo",2023-10-12,"This paper studies close-loop task planning, which refers to the process of generating a sequence of skills (a plan) to accomplish a specific goal while adapting the plan based on real-time observations. Recently, prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalent paradigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, this paradigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundant error correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testing and applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, which reframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling, action tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by using an LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by the aggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs a top-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-time environmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposing LLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-deciding calls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedly consumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2% compared to the previously best-performing model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on the action tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading to a 40.5% decrease in error corrections.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08582v2

Our main contribution is to enable optimal hierarchical LTL planning with LLM guidance over scene graphs. To achieve efficiency, we construct a hierarchical planning domain that captures the attributes and connectivity of the scene graph and the task automaton, and provide semantic guidance via an LLM heuristic function. To guarantee optimality, we design an LTL heuristic function that is provably consistent and supplements the potentially inadmissible LLM guidance in multi-heuristic planning. We demonstrate efficient planning of complex natural language tasks in scene graphs of virtualized real environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09182v2
From Cooking Recipes to Robot Task Trees -- Improving Planning Correctness and Task Efficiency by Leveraging LLMs with a Knowledge Network,"Md Sadman Sakib, Yu Sun",2023-09-17,"Task planning for robotic cooking involves generating a sequence of actions for a robot to prepare a meal successfully. This paper introduces a novel task tree generation pipeline producing correct planning and efficient execution for cooking tasks. Our method first uses a large language model (LLM) to retrieve recipe instructions and then utilizes a fine-tuned GPT-3 to convert them into a task tree, capturing sequential and parallel dependencies among subtasks. The pipeline then mitigates the uncertainty and unreliable features of LLM outputs using task tree retrieval. We combine multiple LLM task tree outputs into a graph and perform a task tree retrieval to avoid questionable nodes and high-cost nodes to improve planning correctness and improve execution efficiency. Our evaluation results show its superior performance compared to previous works in task planning accuracy and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09181v1
Unified Human-Scene Interaction via Prompted Chain-of-Contacts,"Zeqi Xiao, Tai Wang, Jingbo Wang, Jinkun Cao, Wenwei Zhang, Bo Dai, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang",2023-09-14,"Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

GRID: Scene-Graph-based Instruction-driven Robotic Task Planning,"Zhe Ni, Xiaoxin Deng, Cong Tai, Xinyue Zhu, Qinghongbing Xie, Weihang Huang, Xiang Wu, Long Zeng",2023-09-14,"Recent works have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can facilitate the grounding of instructions for robotic task planning. Despite this progress, most existing works have primarily focused on utilizing raw images to aid LLMs in understanding environmental information. However, this approach not only limits the scope of observation but also typically necessitates extensive multimodal data collection and large-scale models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Graph-based Robotic Instruction Decomposer (GRID), which leverages scene graphs instead of images to perceive global scene information and iteratively plan subtasks for a given instruction. Our method encodes object attributes and relationships in graphs through an LLM and Graph Attention Networks, integrating instruction features to predict subtasks consisting of pre-defined robot actions and target objects in the scene graph. This strategy enables robots to acquire semantic knowledge widely observed in the environment from the scene graph. To train and evaluate GRID, we establish a dataset construction pipeline to generate synthetic datasets for graph-based robotic task planning. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms GPT-4 by over 25.4% in subtask accuracy and 43.6% in task accuracy. Moreover, our method achieves a real-time speed of 0.11s per inference. Experiments conducted on datasets of unseen scenes and scenes with varying numbers of objects demonstrate that the task accuracy of GRID declined by at most 3.8%, showcasing its robust cross-scene generalization ability. We validate our method in both physical simulation and the real world. More details can be found on the project page https://jackyzengl.github.io/GRID.github.io/.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07726v2
Recommender AI Agent: Integrating Large Language Models for Interactive Recommendations,"Xu Huang, Jianxun Lian, Yuxuan Lei, Jing Yao, Defu Lian, Xing Xie",2023-08-31,"Recommender models excel at providing domain-specific item recommendations by leveraging extensive user behavior data. Despite their ability to act as lightweight domain experts, they struggle to perform versatile tasks such as providing explanations and engaging in conversations. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) represent a significant step towards artificial general intelligence, showcasing remarkable capabilities in instruction comprehension, commonsense reasoning, and human interaction. However, LLMs lack the knowledge of domain-specific item catalogs and behavioral patterns, particularly in areas that diverge from general world knowledge, such as online e-commerce. Finetuning LLMs for each domain is neither economic nor efficient.   In this paper, we bridge the gap between recommender models and LLMs, combining their respective strengths to create a versatile and interactive recommender system. We introduce an efficient framework called \textbf{InteRecAgent}, which employs LLMs as the brain and recommender models as tools. We first outline a minimal set of essential tools required to transform LLMs into InteRecAgent. We then propose an efficient workflow within InteRecAgent for task execution, incorporating key components such as memory components, dynamic demonstration-augmented task planning, and reflection. InteRecAgent enables traditional recommender systems, such as those ID-based matrix factorization models, to become interactive systems with a natural language interface through the integration of LLMs. Experimental results on several public datasets show that InteRecAgent achieves satisfying performance as a conversational recommender system, outperforming general-purpose LLMs. The source code of InteRecAgent is released at https://aka.ms/recagent.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16505v3

LLMs are advantageous in offering the potential to enhance the generalizability as task-agnostic planners and facilitate flexible interaction between human instructors and planning systems. However, task plans generated by LLMs often lack feasibility and correctness. To address this challenge, we introduce ISR-LLM, a novel framework that improves LLM-based planning through an iterative self-refinement process. The framework operates through three sequential steps: preprocessing, planning, and iterative self-refinement. During preprocessing, an LLM translator is employed to convert natural language input into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) formulation. In the planning phase, an LLM planner formulates an initial plan, which is then assessed and refined in the iterative self-refinement step by using a validator. We examine the performance of ISR-LLM across three distinct planning domains. The results show that ISR-LLM is able to achieve markedly higher success rates in task accomplishments compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planners.

New Interaction Paradigm for Complex EDA Software Leveraging GPT,"Boyu Han, Xinyu Wang, Yifan Wang, Junyu Yan, Yidong Tian",2023-07-27,"In the rapidly growing field of electronic design automation (EDA), professional software such as KiCad, Cadence , and Altium Designer provide increasingly extensive design functionalities. However, the intricate command structure and high learning curve create a barrier, particularly for novice printed circuit board (PCB) designers. This results in difficulties in selecting appropriate functions or plugins for varying design purposes, compounded by the lack of intuitive learning methods beyond traditional documentation, videos, and online forums. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence (AI) interaction assist plugin for EDA software named SmartonAl is developed here, also KiCad is taken as the first example. SmartonAI is inspired by the HuggingGPT framework and employs large language models, such as GPT and BERT, to facilitate task planning and execution. On receiving a designer request, SmartonAI conducts a task breakdown and efficiently executes relevant subtasks, such as analysis of help documentation paragraphs and execution of different plugins, along with leveraging the built-in schematic and PCB manipulation functions in both SmartonAl itself and software. Our preliminary results demonstrate that SmartonAI can significantly streamline the PCB design process by simplifying complex commands into intuitive language-based interactions. By harnessing the powerful language capabilities of ChatGPT and the rich design functions of KiCad, the plugin effectively bridges the gap between complex EDA software and user-friendly interaction.

However, grounding these plans in expansive, multi-floor, and multi-room environments presents a significant challenge for robotics. We introduce SayPlan, a scalable approach to LLM-based, large-scale task planning for robotics using 3D scene graph (3DSG) representations. To ensure the scalability of our approach, we: (1) exploit the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs to allow LLMs to conduct a 'semantic search' for task-relevant subgraphs from a smaller, collapsed representation of the full graph; (2) reduce the planning horizon for the LLM by integrating a classical path planner and (3) introduce an 'iterative replanning' pipeline that refines the initial plan using feedback from a scene graph simulator, correcting infeasible actions and avoiding planning failures. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale environments spanning up to 3 floors and 36 rooms with 140 assets and objects and show that our approach is capable of grounding large-scale, long-horizon task plans from abstract, and natural language instruction for a mobile manipulator robot to execute.

AlphaBlock: Embodied Finetuning for Vision-Language Reasoning in Robot Manipulation,"Chuhao Jin, Wenhui Tan, Jiange Yang, Bei Liu, Ruihua Song, Limin Wang, Jianlong Fu",2023-05-30,"We propose a novel framework for learning high-level cognitive capabilities in robot manipulation tasks, such as making a smiley face using building blocks. These tasks often involve complex multi-step reasoning, presenting significant challenges due to the limited paired data connecting human instructions (e.g., making a smiley face) and robot actions (e.g., end-effector movement). Existing approaches relieve this challenge by adopting an open-loop paradigm decomposing high-level instructions into simple sub-task plans, and executing them step-by-step using low-level control models. However, these approaches are short of instant observations in multi-step reasoning, leading to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose to automatically collect a cognitive robot dataset by Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting dataset AlphaBlock consists of 35 comprehensive high-level tasks of multi-step text plans and paired observation sequences. To enable efficient data acquisition, we employ elaborated multi-round prompt designs that effectively reduce the burden of extensive human involvement.

Integrating Action Knowledge and LLMs for Task Planning and Situation Handling in Open Worlds,"Yan Ding, Xiaohan Zhang, Saeid Amiri, Nieqing Cao, Hao Yang, Andy Kaminski, Chad Esselink, Shiqi Zhang",2023-05-27,"Task planning systems have been developed to help robots use human knowledge (about actions) to complete long-horizon tasks. Most of them have been developed for ""closed worlds"" while assuming the robot is provided with complete world knowledge. However, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break the planner's completeness. Could we leverage the recent advances on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable classical planning systems to deal with novel situations?   This paper introduces a novel framework, called COWP, for open-world task planning and situation handling. COWP dynamically augments the robot's action knowledge, including the preconditions and effects of actions, with task-oriented commonsense knowledge. COWP embraces the openness from LLMs, and is grounded to specific domains via action knowledge. For systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 1,085 execution-time situations. Each situation corresponds to a state instance wherein a robot is potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks.

Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models to Construct and Utilize World Models for Model-based Task Planning,"Lin Guan, Karthik Valmeekam, Sarath Sreedharan, Subbarao Kambhampati",2023-05-24,"There is a growing interest in applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to planning problems. However, methods that use LLMs directly as planners are currently impractical due to several factors, including limited correctness of plans, strong reliance on feedback from interactions with simulators or even the actual environment, and the inefficiency in utilizing human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel alternative paradigm that constructs an explicit world (domain) model in planning domain definition language (PDDL) and then uses it to plan with sound domain-independent planners. To address the fact that LLMs may not generate a fully functional PDDL model initially, we employ LLMs as an interface between PDDL and sources of corrective feedback, such as PDDL validators and humans. For users who lack a background in PDDL, we show that LLMs can translate PDDL into natural language and effectively encode corrective feedback back to the underlying domain model. Our framework not only enjoys the correctness guarantee offered by the external planners but also reduces human involvement by allowing users to correct domain models at the beginning, rather than inspecting and correcting (through interactive prompting) every generated plan as in previous work. On two IPC domains and a Household domain that is more complicated than commonly used benchmarks such as ALFWorld, we demonstrate that GPT-4 can be leveraged to produce high-quality PDDL models for over 40 actions, and the corrected PDDL models are then used to successfully solve 48 challenging planning tasks.

Large Language Models as Commonsense Knowledge for Large-Scale Task Planning,"Zirui Zhao, Wee Sun Lee, David Hsu",2023-05-23,"Large-scale task planning is a major challenge. Recent work exploits large language models (LLMs) directly as a policy and shows surprisingly interesting results. This paper shows that LLMs provide a commonsense model of the world in addition to a policy that acts on it. The world model and the policy can be combined in a search algorithm, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to scale up task planning. In our new LLM-MCTS algorithm, the LLM-induced world model provides a commonsense prior belief for MCTS to achieve effective reasoning; the LLM-induced policy acts as a heuristic to guide the search, vastly improving search efficiency. Experiments show that LLM-MCTS outperforms both MCTS alone and policies induced by LLMs (GPT2 and GPT3.5) by a wide margin, for complex, novel tasks. Further experiments and analyses on multiple tasks -- multiplication, multi-hop travel planning, object rearrangement -- suggest minimum description length (MDL) as a general guiding principle: if the description length of the world model is substantially smaller than that of the policy, using LLM as a world model for model-based planning is likely better than using LLM solely as a policy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14078v2

Low-level functionalities are executed by automation components, and high-level skills are performed by automation modules. Subsequently, a digital twin system is developed, registering these interfaces and containing additional descriptive information about the production system. Based on the retrofitted automation system and the created digital twins, LLM-agents are designed to interpret descriptive information in the digital twins and control the physical system through service interfaces. These LLM-agents serve as intelligent agents on different levels within an automation system, enabling autonomous planning and control of flexible production. Given a task instruction as input, the LLM-agents orchestrate a sequence of atomic functionalities and skills to accomplish the task. We demonstrate how our implemented prototype can handle un-predefined tasks, plan a production process, and execute the operations.

A further challenge is ensuring this is all true while still being able to learn skills efficiently from limited data. We propose Spatial-Language Attention Policies (SLAP) as a solution. SLAP uses three-dimensional tokens as the input representation to train a single multi-task, language-conditioned action prediction policy. Our method shows an 80% success rate in the real world across eight tasks with a single model, and a 47.5% success rate when unseen clutter and unseen object configurations are introduced, even with only a handful of examples per task. This represents an improvement of 30% over prior work (20% given unseen distractors and configurations). We see a 4x improvement over baseline in mobile manipulation setting. In addition, we show how SLAPs robustness allows us to execute Task Plans from open-vocabulary instructions using a large language model for multi-step mobile manipulation.

Learning to Plan with Natural Language,"Yiduo Guo, Yaobo Liang, Chenfei Wu, Wenshan Wu, Dongyan Zhao, Nan Duan",2023-04-20,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various basic natural language tasks. For completing the complex task, we still need a plan for the task to guide LLMs to generate the specific solutions step by step. LLMs can directly generate task plans, but these plans may still contain factual errors or are incomplete. A high-quality task plan contains correct step-by-step solutions for solving all situations and behavioral instructions for avoiding mistakes. To obtain it, we propose the Learning to Plan method, which involves two phases: (1) In the first learning task plan phase, it iteratively updates the task plan with new step-by-step solutions and behavioral instructions, which are obtained by prompting LLMs to derive from training error feedback. (2) In the subsequent test phase, the LLM uses the learned task plan to guide the inference of LLM on the test set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the five different reasoning type tasks (8 datasets). Further, our analysis experiment shows that the task plan learned by one LLM can directly guide another LLM to improve its performance, which reveals a new transfer learning paradigm.

HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face,"Yongliang Shen, Kaitao Song, Xu Tan, Dongsheng Li, Weiming Lu, Yueting Zhuang",2023-03-30,"Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. While there are numerous AI models available for various domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks autonomously. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional abilities in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks, with language serving as a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, an LLM-powered agent that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in Hugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face, HuggingGPT can tackle a wide range of sophisticated AI tasks spanning different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards the realization of artificial general intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580v4
Errors are Useful Prompts: Instruction Guided Task Programming with Verifier-Assisted Iterative Prompting,"Marta Skreta, Naruki Yoshikawa, Sebastian Arellano-Rubach, Zhi Ji, Lasse Bjørn Kristensen, Kourosh Darvish, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Florian Shkurti, Animesh Garg",2023-03-24,"Generating low-level robot task plans from high-level natural language instructions remains a challenging problem.

In this paper, we propose CLAIRIFY, a novel approach that combines automatic iterative prompting with program verification to ensure programs written in data-scarce domain-specific language are syntactically valid and incorporate environment constraints. Our approach provides effective guidance to the language model on generating structured-like task plans by incorporating any errors as feedback, while the verifier ensures the syntactic accuracy of the generated plans.

Given a natural language instruction, our framework constructs both a task- and motion-level plan that is verified to reach inferred symbolic goals. Text2Motion uses feasibility heuristics encoded in Q-functions of a library of skills to guide task planning with Large Language Models. Whereas previous language-based planners only consider the feasibility of individual skills, Text2Motion actively resolves geometric dependencies spanning skill sequences by performing geometric feasibility planning during its search. We evaluate our method on a suite of problems that require long-horizon reasoning, interpretation of abstract goals, and handling of partial affordance perception. Our experiments show that Text2Motion can solve these challenging problems with a success rate of 82%, while prior state-of-the-art language-based planning methods only achieve 13%.

A Framework for Neurosymbolic Robot Action Planning using Large Language Models,"Alessio Capitanelli, Fulvio Mastrogiovanni",2023-03-01,"Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy due to its ease of understanding and deployment in robot architectures. However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in real-world, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance in complex planning domains or when frequent re-planning is needed. We present a framework, Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs' response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the output, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of end-to-end, making each action available for execution as soon as it is generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn enables concurrent planning and execution. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted by the research community to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to provide an overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities to build a look-ahead predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000 samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by up to 61.4%",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00438v3
"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select: Interactive Planning with Large Language Models Enables Open-World Multi-Task Agents","Zihao Wang, Shaofei Cai, Guanzhou Chen, Anji Liu, Xiaojian Ma, Yitao Liang",2023-02-03,"We investigate the challenge of task planning for multi-task embodied agents in open-world environments. Two main difficulties are identified: 1) executing plans in an open-world environment (e.g., Minecraft) necessitates accurate and multi-step reasoning due to the long-term nature of tasks, and 2) as vanilla planners do not consider how easy the current agent can achieve a given sub-task when ordering parallel sub-goals within a complicated plan, the resulting plan could be inefficient or even infeasible. To this end, we propose ""$\underline{D}$escribe, $\underline{E}$xplain, $\underline{P}$lan and $\underline{S}$elect"" ($\textbf{DEPS}$), an interactive planning approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs). DEPS facilitates better error correction on initial LLM-generated $\textit{plan}$ by integrating $\textit{description}$ of the plan execution process and providing self-$\textit{explanation}$ of feedback when encountering failures during the extended planning phases. Furthermore, it includes a goal $\textit{selector}$, which is a trainable module that ranks parallel candidate sub-goals based on the estimated steps of completion, consequently refining the initial plan. Our experiments mark the milestone of the first zero-shot multi-task agent that can robustly accomplish 70+ Minecraft tasks and nearly double the overall performances. Further testing reveals our method's general effectiveness in popularly adopted non-open-ended domains as well (i.e., ALFWorld and tabletop manipulation).

CAPE improves the quality of generated plans by leveraging few-shot reasoning from action preconditions. Our approach enables embodied agents to execute more tasks than baseline methods while ensuring semantic correctness and minimizing re-prompting. In VirtualHome, CAPE generates executable plans while improving a human-annotated plan correctness metric from 28.89% to 49.63% over SayCan. Our improvements transfer to a Boston Dynamics Spot robot initialized with a set of skills (specified in language) and associated preconditions, where CAPE improves the correctness metric of the executed task plans by 76.49% compared to SayCan.

Robot Task Planning and Situation Handling in Open Worlds,"Yan Ding, Xiaohan Zhang, Saeid Amiri, Nieqing Cao, Hao Yang, Chad Esselink, Shiqi Zhang",2022-10-04,"Automated task planning algorithms have been developed to help robots complete complex tasks that require multiple actions. Most of those algorithms have been developed for ""closed worlds"" assuming complete world knowledge is provided. However, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break the planner's completeness. This paper introduces a novel algorithm (COWP) for open-world task planning and situation handling that dynamically augments the robot's action knowledge with task-oriented common sense. In particular, common sense is extracted from Large Language Models based on the current task at hand and robot skills. For systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 561 execution-time situations in a dining domain, where each situation corresponds to a state instance of a robot being potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks. Additionally, we have demonstrated COWP using a mobile manipulator. Supplementary materials are available at: https://cowplanning.github.io/",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01287v1

To ameliorate that effort, large language models (LLMs) can be used to score potential next actions during task planning, and even generate action sequences directly, given an instruction in natural language with no additional domain information. However, such methods either require enumerating all possible next steps for scoring, or generate free-form text that may contain actions not possible on a given robot in its current context. We present a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation functional across situated environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. Our key insight is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, as well as with example programs that can be executed. We make concrete recommendations about prompt structure and generation constraints through ablation experiments, demonstrate state of the art success rates in VirtualHome household tasks, and deploy our method on a physical robot arm for tabletop tasks.

However, prior attempts to apply LLMs to real-world robotic tasks are limited by the lack of grounding in the surrounding scene. In this paper, we develop NLMap, an open-vocabulary and queryable scene representation to address this problem. NLMap serves as a framework to gather and integrate contextual information into LLM planners, allowing them to see and query available objects in the scene before generating a context-conditioned plan. NLMap first establishes a natural language queryable scene representation with Visual Language models (VLMs). An LLM based object proposal module parses instructions and proposes involved objects to query the scene representation for object availability and location. An LLM planner then plans with such information about the scene. NLMap allows robots to operate without a fixed list of objects nor executable options, enabling real robot operation unachievable by previous methods.

Our framework not only enhances area coverage and optimizes task performance, particularly in terms of makespan, for workspaces rich in irregular obstacles but also addresses the challenges of path continuity and curvature critical for non-holonomic robots by generating smooth paths without decomposing the workspace. MCFS solves MCPP by constructing a graph of isolines and transforming MCPP into a combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to minimize the makespan while covering all vertices. Our contributions include developing a unified CFS version for scalable and adaptable MCPP, extending it to MCPP with novel optimization techniques for cost reduction and path continuity and smoothness, and demonstrating through extensive experiments that MCFS outperforms existing MCPP methods in makespan, path curvature, coverage ratio, and overlapping ratio.

Reformulation Techniques for Automated Planning: A Systematic Review,"Diaeddin Alarnaouti, George Baryannis, Mauro Vallati",2023-01-24,"Automated planning is a prominent area of Artificial Intelligence, and an important component for intelligent autonomous agents. A cornerstone of domain-independent planning is the separation between planning logic, i.e. the automated reasoning side, and the knowledge model, that encodes a formal representation of domain knowledge needed to reason upon a given problem to synthesise a solution plan. Such a separation enables the use of reformulation techniques, which transform how a model is represented in order to improve the efficiency of plan generation. Over the past decades, significant research effort has been devoted to the design of reformulation techniques. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the large body of work on reformulation techniques for classical planning, aiming to provide a holistic view of the field and to foster future research in the area.

Provenance-Based Assessment of Plans in Context,"Scott E. Friedman, Robert P. Goldman, Richard G.

This paper presents a provenance-based approach to explaining automated plans. Our approach (1) extends the SHOP3 HTN planner to generate dependency information, (2) transforms the dependency information into an established PROV-O representation, and (3) uses graph propagation and TMS-inspired algorithms to support dynamic and counter-factual assessment of information flow, confidence, and support.

Leveraging Environment Interaction for Automated PDDL Generation and Planning with Large Language Models,"Sadegh Mahdavi, Raquel Aoki, Keyi Tang, Yanshuai Cao",2024-07-17,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language tasks, but they often struggle with planning problems that require structured reasoning.

However, generating accurate PDDL files typically demands human inputs or correction, which can be time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages LLMs and environment feedback to automatically generate PDDL domain and problem description files without the need for human intervention. Our method introduces an iterative refinement process that generates multiple problem PDDL candidates and progressively refines the domain PDDL based on feedback obtained from interacting with the environment. To guide the refinement process, we develop an Exploration Walk (EW) metric, which provides rich feedback signals for LLMs to update the PDDL file. We evaluate our approach on PDDL environments. We achieve an average task solve rate of 66% compared to a 29% solve rate by GPT-4's intrinsic planning with chain-of-thought prompting.

LLM+Reasoning+Planning for supporting incomplete user queries in presence of APIs,"Sudhir Agarwal, Anu Sreepathy, David H. Alonso, Prarit Lamba",2024-05-21,"Recent availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of numerous LLM-based approaches aimed at providing natural language interfaces for various end-user tasks. These end-user tasks in turn can typically be accomplished by orchestrating a given set of APIs. In practice, natural language task requests (user queries) are often incomplete, i.e., they may not contain all the information required by the APIs. While LLMs excel at natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they frequently hallucinate on missing information or struggle with orchestrating the APIs. The key idea behind our proposed approach is to leverage logical reasoning and classical AI planning along with an LLM for accurately answering user queries including identification and gathering of any missing information in these queries. Our approach uses an LLM and ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to translate a user query to a representation in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) via an intermediate representation in ASP. We introduce a special API ""get_info_api"" for gathering missing information. We model all the APIs as PDDL actions in a way that supports dataflow between the APIs. Our approach then uses a classical AI planner to generate an orchestration of API calls (including calls to get_info_api) to answer the user query.

However, these methods still require various degrees of expert input. We present NL2Plan, the first domain-agnostic offline LLM-driven planning system. NL2Plan uses an LLM to incrementally extract the necessary information from a short text prompt before creating a complete PDDL description of both the domain and the problem, which is finally solved by a classical planner. We evaluate NL2Plan on four planning domains and find that it solves 10 out of 15 tasks - a clear improvement over a plain chain-of-thought reasoning LLM approach, which only solves 2 tasks. Moreover, in two out of the five failure cases, instead of returning an invalid plan, NL2Plan reports that it failed to solve the task. In addition to using NL2Plan in end-to-end mode, users can inspect and correct all of its intermediate results, such as the PDDL representation, increasing explainability and making it an assistive tool for PDDL creation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04215v1

TwoStep: Multi-agent Task Planning using Classical Planners and Large Language Models,"Ishika Singh, David Traum, Jesse Thomason",2024-03-25,"Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, for example that two agents in the domain can execute an action simultaneously if postconditions of each do not interfere with preconditions of the other. A human expert can decompose a goal into largely independent constituent parts and assign each agent to one of these subgoals to take advantage of simultaneous actions for faster execution of plan steps, each using only single agent planning. By contrast, large language models (LLMs) used for directly inferring plan steps do not guarantee execution success, but do leverage commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. We combine the strengths of classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for two-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone and preserving execution success. Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of subgoals can achieve similar multi-agent execution steps than those specified by human experts.

Unlike previous approaches that use LLMs for generating task PDDLs directly, our approach comprises of (a) translate: using an LLM only for generating a logically interpretable intermediate representation of natural language task description, (b) infer: deriving additional logically dependent information from the intermediate representation using a logic reasoner (currently, Answer Set Programming solver), and (c) compile: generating the target task PDDL from the base and inferred information. We observe that using an LLM to only output the intermediate representation significantly reduces LLM errors. Consequently, TIC approach achieves, for at least one LLM, high accuracy on task PDDL generation for all seven domains of our evaluation dataset.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06608v2
Consolidating Trees of Robotic Plans Generated Using Large Language Models to Improve Reliability,"Md Sadman Sakib, Yu Sun",2024-01-15,"The inherent probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces an element of unpredictability, raising concerns about potential discrepancies in their output. This paper introduces an innovative approach aims to generate correct and optimal robotic task plans for diverse real-world demands and scenarios. LLMs have been used to generate task plans, but they are unreliable and may contain wrong, questionable, or high-cost steps. The proposed approach uses LLM to generate a number of task plans as trees and amalgamates them into a graph by removing questionable paths. Then an optimal task tree can be retrieved to circumvent questionable and high-cost nodes, thereby improving planning accuracy and execution efficiency. The approach is further improved by incorporating a large knowledge network. Leveraging GPT-4 further, the high-level task plan is converted into a low-level Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) plan executable by a robot. Evaluation results highlight the superior accuracy and efficiency of our approach compared to previous methodologies in the field of task planning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07868v1

Integration of Large Language Models within Cognitive Architectures for Autonomous Robots,"Miguel Á. González-Santamarta, Francisco J. Rodríguez-Lera, Ángel Manuel Guerrero-Higueras, Vicente Matellán-Olivera",2023-09-26,"Symbolic reasoning systems have been used in cognitive architectures to provide inference and planning capabilities. However, defining domains and problems has proven difficult and prone to errors. Moreover, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools to process natural language for different tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of LLMs to tackle these problems. This way, this paper proposes the integration of LLMs in the ROS 2-integrated cognitive architecture MERLIN2 for autonomous robots. Specifically, we present the design, development and deployment of how to leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs inside the deliberative processes of MERLIN2. As a result, the deliberative system is updated from a PDDL-based planner system to a natural language planning system. This proposal is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, measuring the impact of incorporating the LLMs in the cognitive architecture. Results show that a classical approach achieves better performance but the proposed solution provides an enhanced interaction through natural language.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14945v2
ISR-LLM: Iterative Self-Refined Large Language Model for Long-Horizon Sequential Task Planning,"Zhehua Zhou, Jiayang Song, Kunpeng Yao, Zhan Shu, Lei Ma",2023-08-26,"Motivated by the substantial achievements observed in Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of natural language processing, recent research has commenced investigations into the application of LLMs for complex, long-horizon sequential task planning challenges in robotics. LLMs are advantageous in offering the potential to enhance the generalizability as task-agnostic planners and facilitate flexible interaction between human instructors and planning systems. However, task plans generated by LLMs often lack feasibility and correctness. To address this challenge, we introduce ISR-LLM, a novel framework that improves LLM-based planning through an iterative self-refinement process. The framework operates through three sequential steps: preprocessing, planning, and iterative self-refinement. During preprocessing, an LLM translator is employed to convert natural language input into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) formulation. In the planning phase, an LLM planner formulates an initial plan, which is then assessed and refined in the iterative self-refinement step by using a validator. We examine the performance of ISR-LLM across three distinct planning domains. The results show that ISR-LLM is able to achieve markedly higher success rates in task accomplishments compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planners. Moreover, it also preserves the broad applicability and generalizability of working with natural language instructions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13724v1
SayCanPay: Heuristic Planning with Large Language Models using Learnable Domain Knowledge,"Rishi Hazra, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires, Luc De Raedt",2023-08-24,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive planning abilities due to their vast ""world knowledge"". Yet, obtaining plans that are both feasible (grounded in affordances) and cost-effective (in plan length), remains a challenge, despite recent progress. This contrasts with heuristic planning methods that employ domain knowledge (formalized in action models such as PDDL) and heuristic search to generate feasible, optimal plans. Inspired by this, we propose to combine the power of LLMs and heuristic planning by leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs and the principles of heuristic search. Our approach, SayCanPay, employs LLMs to generate actions (Say) guided by learnable domain knowledge, that evaluates actions' feasibility (Can) and long-term reward/payoff (Pay), and heuristic search to select the best sequence of actions. Our contributions are (1) a novel framing of the LLM planning problem in the context of heuristic planning, (2) integrating grounding and cost-effective elements into the generated plans, and (3) using heuristic search over actions. Our extensive evaluations show that our model surpasses other LLM planning approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12682v2
Grammar Prompting for Domain-Specific Language Generation with Large Language Models,"Bailin Wang, Zi Wang, Xuezhi Wang, Yuan Cao, Rif A. Saurous, Yoon Kim",2023-05-30,"Large language models (LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of natural language tasks from just a handful of in-context examples. However, for generating strings from highly structured languages (e.g., semantic parsing to complex domain-specific languages), it is challenging for the LLM to generalize from just a few exemplars. We propose \emph{grammar prompting}, a simple approach to enable LLMs to use external knowledge and domain-specific constraints, expressed through a grammar in Backus--Naur Form (BNF), during in-context learning. Grammar prompting augments each demonstration example with a specialized grammar that is minimally sufficient for generating the particular output example, where the specialized grammar is a subset of the full DSL grammar. For inference, the LLM first predicts a BNF grammar given a test input, and then generates the output according to the rules of the grammar. Experiments demonstrate that grammar prompting can enable LLMs to perform competitively on a diverse set of DSL generation tasks, including semantic parsing (SMCalFlow, Overnight, GeoQuery), PDDL planning, and SMILES-based molecule generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19234v3
Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models to Construct and Utilize World Models for Model-based Task Planning,"Lin Guan, Karthik Valmeekam, Sarath Sreedharan, Subbarao Kambhampati",2023-05-24,"There is a growing interest in applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to planning problems. However, methods that use LLMs directly as planners are currently impractical due to several factors, including limited correctness of plans, strong reliance on feedback from interactions with simulators or even the actual environment, and the inefficiency in utilizing human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel alternative paradigm that constructs an explicit world (domain) model in planning domain definition language (PDDL) and then uses it to plan with sound domain-independent planners. To address the fact that LLMs may not generate a fully functional PDDL model initially, we employ LLMs as an interface between PDDL and sources of corrective feedback, such as PDDL validators and humans. For users who lack a background in PDDL, we show that LLMs can translate PDDL into natural language and effectively encode corrective feedback back to the underlying domain model. Our framework not only enjoys the correctness guarantee offered by the external planners but also reduces human involvement by allowing users to correct domain models at the beginning, rather than inspecting and correcting (through interactive prompting) every generated plan as in previous work. On two IPC domains and a Household domain that is more complicated than commonly used benchmarks such as ALFWorld, we demonstrate that GPT-4 can be leveraged to produce high-quality PDDL models for over 40 actions, and the corrected PDDL models are then used to successfully solve 48 challenging planning tasks.

Generalized Planning in PDDL Domains with Pretrained Large Language Models,"Tom Silver, Soham Dan, Kavitha Srinivas, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Leslie Pack Kaelbling, Michael Katz",2023-05-18,"Recent work has considered whether large language models (LLMs) can function as planners: given a task, generate a plan. We investigate whether LLMs can serve as generalized planners: given a domain and training tasks, generate a program that efficiently produces plans for other tasks in the domain. In particular, we consider PDDL domains and use GPT-4 to synthesize Python programs. We also consider (1) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) summarization, where the LLM is prompted to summarize the domain and propose a strategy in words before synthesizing the program; and (2) automated debugging, where the program is validated with respect to the training tasks, and in case of errors, the LLM is re-prompted with four types of feedback. We evaluate this approach in seven PDDL domains and compare it to four ablations and four baselines. Overall, we find that GPT-4 is a surprisingly powerful generalized planner. We also conclude that automated debugging is very important, that CoT summarization has non-uniform impact, that GPT-4 is far superior to GPT-3.5, and that just two training tasks are often sufficient for strong generalization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11014v2
LLM+P: Empowering Large Language Models with Optimal Planning Proficiency,"Bo Liu, Yuqian Jiang, Xiaohan Zhang, Qiang Liu, Shiqi Zhang, Joydeep Biswas, Peter Stone",2023-04-22,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization abilities: state-of-the-art chatbots can provide plausible answers to many common questions that arise in daily life. However, so far, LLMs cannot reliably solve long-horizon planning problems. By contrast, classical planners, once a problem is given in a formatted way, can use efficient search algorithms to quickly identify correct, or even optimal, plans. In an effort to get the best of both worlds, this paper introduces LLM+P, the first framework that incorporates the strengths of classical planners into LLMs. LLM+P takes in a natural language description of a planning problem, then returns a correct (or optimal) plan for solving that problem in natural language. LLM+P does so by first converting the language description into a file written in the planning domain definition language (PDDL), then leveraging classical planners to quickly find a solution, and then translating the found solution back into natural language. Along with LLM+P, we define a diverse set of different benchmark problems taken from common planning scenarios. Via a comprehensive set of experiments on these benchmark problems, we find that LLM+P is able to provide optimal solutions for most problems, while LLMs fail to provide even feasible plans for most problems.\footnote{The code and results are publicly available at https://github.com/Cranial-XIX/llm-pddl.git.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11477v3
A Framework for Neurosymbolic Robot Action Planning using Large Language Models,"Alessio Capitanelli, Fulvio Mastrogiovanni",2023-03-01,"Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy due to its ease of understanding and deployment in robot architectures. However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in real-world, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance in complex planning domains or when frequent re-planning is needed. We present a framework, Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs' response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the output, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of end-to-end, making each action available for execution as soon as it is generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn enables concurrent planning and execution. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted by the research community to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to provide an overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities to build a look-ahead predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000 samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by up to 61.4%",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00438v3
GPT-4V(ision) for Robotics: Multimodal Task Planning from Human Demonstration,"Naoki Wake, Atsushi Kanehira, Kazuhiro Sasabuchi, Jun Takamatsu, Katsushi Ikeuchi",2023-11-20,"We introduce a pipeline that enhances a general-purpose Vision Language Model, GPT-4V(ision), to facilitate one-shot visual teaching for robotic manipulation. This system analyzes videos of humans performing tasks and outputs executable robot programs that incorporate insights into affordances. The process begins with GPT-4V analyzing the videos to obtain textual explanations of environmental and action details. A GPT-4-based task planner then encodes these details into a symbolic task plan. Subsequently, vision systems spatially and temporally ground the task plan in the videos. Object are identified using an open-vocabulary object detector, and hand-object interactions are analyzed to pinpoint moments of grasping and releasing. This spatiotemporal grounding allows for the gathering of affordance information (e.g., grasp types, waypoints, and body postures) critical for robot execution. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate the method's efficacy in achieving real robots' operations from human demonstrations in a one-shot manner. Meanwhile, quantitative tests have revealed instances of hallucination in GPT-4V, highlighting the importance of incorporating human supervision within the pipeline.

Conformant Planning via Symbolic Model Checking,"A. Cimatti, M. Roveri",2011-06-01,"We tackle the problem of planning in nondeterministic domains, by presenting a new approach to conformant planning. Conformant planning is the problem of finding a sequence of actions that is guaranteed to achieve the goal despite the nondeterminism of the domain. Our approach is based on the representation of the planning domain as a finite state automaton. We use Symbolic Model Checking techniques, in particular Binary Decision Diagrams, to compactly represent and efficiently search the automaton. In this paper we make the following contributions. First, we present a general planning algorithm for conformant planning, which applies to fully nondeterministic domains, with uncertainty in the initial condition and in action effects. The algorithm is based on a breadth-first, backward search, and returns conformant plans of minimal length, if a solution to the planning problem exists, otherwise it terminates concluding that the problem admits no conformant solution. Second, we provide a symbolic representation of the search space based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), which is the basis for search techniques derived from symbolic model checking. The symbolic representation makes it possible to analyze potentially large sets of states and transitions in a single computation step, thus providing for an efficient implementation. Third, we present CMBP (Conformant Model Based Planner), an efficient implementation of the data structures and algorithm described above, directly based on BDD manipulations, which allows for a compact representation of the search layers and an efficient implementation of the search steps. Finally, we present an experimental comparison of our approach with the state-of-the-art conformant planners CGP, QBFPLAN and GPT. Our analysis includes all the planning problems from the distribution packages of these systems, plus other problems defined to stress a number of specific factors. Our approach appears to be the most effective: CMBP is strictly more expressive than QBFPLAN and CGP and, in all the problems where a comparison is possible, CMBP outperforms its competitors, sometimes by orders of magnitude.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0252v1
New Interaction Paradigm for Complex EDA Software Leveraging GPT,"Boyu Han, Xinyu Wang, Yifan Wang, Junyu Yan, Yidong Tian",2023-07-27,"In the rapidly growing field of electronic design automation (EDA), professional software such as KiCad, Cadence , and Altium Designer provide increasingly extensive design functionalities. However, the intricate command structure and high learning curve create a barrier, particularly for novice printed circuit board (PCB) designers. This results in difficulties in selecting appropriate functions or plugins for varying design purposes, compounded by the lack of intuitive learning methods beyond traditional documentation, videos, and online forums. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence (AI) interaction assist plugin for EDA software named SmartonAl is developed here, also KiCad is taken as the first example. SmartonAI is inspired by the HuggingGPT framework and employs large language models, such as GPT and BERT, to facilitate task planning and execution. On receiving a designer request, SmartonAI conducts a task breakdown and efficiently executes relevant subtasks, such as analysis of help documentation paragraphs and execution of different plugins, along with leveraging the built-in schematic and PCB manipulation functions in both SmartonAl itself and software. Our preliminary results demonstrate that SmartonAI can significantly streamline the PCB design process by simplifying complex commands into intuitive language-based interactions. By harnessing the powerful language capabilities of ChatGPT and the rich design functions of KiCad, the plugin effectively bridges the gap between complex EDA software and user-friendly interaction. Meanwhile, the new paradigm behind SmartonAI can also extend to other complex software systems, illustrating the immense potential of AI-assisted user interfaces in advancing digital interactions across various domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14740v1
Revolutionizing Battery Disassembly: The Design and Implementation of a Battery Disassembly Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(BEAM-1),"Yanlong Peng, Zhigang Wang, Yisheng Zhang, Shengmin Zhang, Nan Cai, Fan Wu, Ming Chen",2024-07-09,"The efficient disassembly of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries(EOL-EVBs) is crucial for green manufacturing and sustainable development. The current pre-programmed disassembly conducted by the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(AMMR) struggles to meet the disassembly requirements in dynamic environments, complex scenarios, and unstructured processes. In this paper, we propose a Battery Disassembly AMMR(BEAM-1) system based on NeuralSymbolic AI. It detects the environmental state by leveraging a combination of multi-sensors and neural predicates and then translates this information into a quasi-symbolic space. In real-time, it identifies the optimal sequence of action primitives through LLM-heuristic tree search, ensuring high-precision execution of these primitives. Additionally, it employs positional speculative sampling using intuitive networks and achieves the disassembly of various bolt types with a meticulously designed end-effector. Importantly, BEAM-1 is a continuously learning embodied intelligence system capable of subjective reasoning like a human, and possessing intuition. A large number of real scene experiments have proved that it can autonomously perceive, decide, and execute to complete the continuous disassembly of bolts in multiple, multi-category, and complex situations, with a success rate of 98.78%. This research attempts to use NeuroSymbolic AI to give robots real autonomous reasoning, planning, and learning capabilities. BEAM-1 realizes the revolution of battery disassembly.

"Neurosymbolic AI -- Why, What, and How","Amit Sheth, Kaushik Roy, Manas Gaur",2023-05-01,"Humans interact with the environment using a combination of perception - transforming sensory inputs from their environment into symbols, and cognition - mapping symbols to knowledge about the environment for supporting abstraction, reasoning by analogy, and long-term planning. Human perception-inspired machine perception, in the context of AI, refers to large-scale pattern recognition from raw data using neural networks trained using self-supervised learning objectives such as next-word prediction or object recognition. On the other hand, machine cognition encompasses more complex computations, such as using knowledge of the environment to guide reasoning, analogy, and long-term planning. Humans can also control and explain their cognitive functions. This seems to require the retention of symbolic mappings from perception outputs to knowledge about their environment.

We show that it is relatively straightforward to contextualize an LLM so it can generate domain-specific plans. However, these plans may be infeasible for the physical system to execute or the plan may be unsafe for human users. To address this, we propose CPS-LLM, an LLM retrained using an instruction tuning framework, which ensures that generated plans not only align with the physical system dynamics of the CPS but are also safe for human users. The CPS-LLM consists of two innovative components: a) a liquid time constant neural network-based physical dynamics coefficient estimator that can derive coefficients of dynamical models with some unmeasured state variables; b) the model coefficients are then used to train an LLM with prompts embodied with traces from the dynamical system and the corresponding model coefficients.

How Can LLM Guide RL? A Value-Based Approach,"Shenao Zhang, Sirui Zheng, Shuqi Ke, Zhihan Liu, Wanxin Jin, Jianbo Yuan, Yingxiang Yang, Hongxia Yang, Zhaoran Wang",2024-02-25,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the de facto standard practice for sequential decision-making problems by improving future acting policies with feedback. However, RL algorithms may require extensive trial-and-error interactions to collect useful feedback for improvement. On the other hand, recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have showcased impressive capabilities in language understanding and generation, yet they fall short in exploration and self-improvement capabilities for planning tasks, lacking the ability to autonomously refine their responses based on feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we study how the policy prior provided by the LLM can enhance the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. Specifically, we develop an algorithm named LINVIT that incorporates LLM guidance as a regularization factor in value-based RL, leading to significant reductions in the amount of data needed for learning, particularly when the difference between the ideal policy and the LLM-informed policy is small, which suggests that the initial policy is close to optimal, reducing the need for further exploration. Additionally, we present a practical algorithm SLINVIT that simplifies the construction of the value function and employs subgoals to reduce the search complexity.

Aiming to achieve robust and general artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of interest in investigating the reasoning ability of the LLMs. Whereas the textual and numerical reasoning benchmarks adopted by previous works are rather shallow and simple, it is hard to conclude that the LLMs possess strong reasoning ability by merely achieving positive results on these benchmarks. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the LLMs are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require common-sense planning by evaluating their performance on the reinforcement learning benchmarks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth assessment of several state-of-the-art LLMs' reasoning ability based on the inductive logic programming (ILP) benchmark, which is broadly recognized as a representative and challenging measurement for evaluating logic program induction/synthesis systems as it requires inducing strict cause-effect logic to achieve robust deduction on independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples.

LLF-Bench: Benchmark for Interactive Learning from Language Feedback,"Ching-An Cheng, Andrey Kolobov, Dipendra Misra, Allen Nie, Adith Swaminathan",2023-12-11,"We introduce a new benchmark, LLF-Bench (Learning from Language Feedback Benchmark; pronounced as ""elf-bench""), to evaluate the ability of AI agents to interactively learn from natural language feedback and instructions. Learning from language feedback (LLF) is essential for people, largely because the rich information this feedback provides can help a learner avoid much of trial and error and thereby speed up the learning process. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled AI agents to comprehend natural language -- and hence AI agents can potentially benefit from language feedback during learning like humans do. But existing interactive benchmarks do not assess this crucial capability: they either use numeric reward feedback or require no learning at all (only planning or information retrieval). LLF-Bench is designed to fill this omission. LLF-Bench is a diverse collection of sequential decision-making tasks that includes user recommendation, poem writing, navigation, and robot control. The objective of an agent is to interactively solve these tasks based on their natural-language instructions and the feedback received after taking actions. Crucially, to ensure that the agent actually ""learns"" from the feedback, LLF-Bench implements several randomization techniques (such as paraphrasing and environment randomization) to ensure that the task isn't familiar to the agent and that the agent is robust to various verbalizations. In addition, LLF-Bench provides a unified OpenAI Gym interface for all its tasks and allows the users to easily configure the information the feedback conveys (among suggestion, explanation, and instantaneous performance) to study how agents respond to different types of feedback. Together, these features make LLF-Bench a unique research platform for developing and testing LLF agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06853v2
Out of the Cage: How Stochastic Parrots Win in Cyber Security Environments,"Maria Rigaki, Ondřej Lukáš, Carlos A. Catania, Sebastian Garcia",2023-08-23,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity across diverse domains involving text generation, summarization, and various natural language processing tasks.

We present an approach wherein pre-trained LLMs are leveraged as attacking agents in two reinforcement learning environments. Our proposed agents demonstrate similar or better performance against state-of-the-art agents trained for thousands of episodes in most scenarios and configurations. In addition, the best LLM agents perform similarly to human testers of the environment without any additional training process. This design highlights the potential of LLMs to efficiently address complex decision-making tasks within cybersecurity.   Furthermore, we introduce a new network security environment named NetSecGame. The environment is designed to eventually support complex multi-agent scenarios within the network security domain.

Selective Perception: Optimizing State Descriptions with Reinforcement Learning for Language Model Actors,"Kolby Nottingham, Yasaman Razeghi, Kyungmin Kim, JB Lanier, Pierre Baldi, Roy Fox, Sameer Singh",2023-07-21,"Large language models (LLMs) are being applied as actors for sequential decision making tasks in domains such as robotics and games, utilizing their general world knowledge and planning abilities. However, previous work does little to explore what environment state information is provided to LLM actors via language. Exhaustively describing high-dimensional states can impair performance and raise inference costs for LLM actors. Previous LLM actors avoid the issue by relying on hand-engineered, task-specific protocols to determine which features to communicate about a state and which to leave out. In this work, we propose Brief Language INputs for DEcision-making Responses (BLINDER), a method for automatically selecting concise state descriptions by learning a value function for task-conditioned state descriptions. We evaluate BLINDER on the challenging video game NetHack and a robotic manipulation task.

Enabling Intelligent Interactions between an Agent and an LLM: A Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Bin Hu, Chenyang Zhao, Pu Zhang, Zihao Zhou, Yuanhang Yang, Zenglin Xu, Bin Liu",2023-06-06,"Large language models (LLMs) encode a vast amount of world knowledge acquired from massive text datasets. Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs can assist an embodied agent in solving complex sequential decision making tasks by providing high-level instructions. However, interactions with LLMs can be time-consuming. In many practical scenarios, it requires a significant amount of storage space that can only be deployed on remote cloud servers. Additionally, using commercial LLMs can be costly since they may charge based on usage frequency. In this paper, we explore how to enable intelligent cost-effective interactions between a down stream task oriented agent and an LLM. We find that this problem can be naturally formulated by a Markov decision process (MDP), and propose When2Ask, a reinforcement learning based approach that learns when it is necessary to query LLMs for high-level instructions to accomplish a target task. On one side, When2Ask discourages unnecessary redundant interactions, while on the other side, it enables the agent to identify and follow useful instructions from the LLM. This enables the agent to halt an ongoing plan and transition to a more suitable one based on new environmental observations. Experiments on MiniGrid and Habitat environments that entail planning sub-goals demonstrate that When2Ask learns to solve target tasks with only a few necessary interactions with the LLM, significantly reducing interaction costs in testing environments compared with baseline methods.

AdaPlanner: Adaptive Planning from Feedback with Language Models,"Haotian Sun, Yuchen Zhuang, Lingkai Kong, Bo Dai, Chao Zhang",2023-05-26,"Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the potential in acting as autonomous agents for sequential decision-making tasks. However, most existing methods either take actions greedily without planning or rely on static plans that are not adaptable to environmental feedback. Consequently, the sequential decision-making performance of LLM agents degenerates with problem complexity and plan horizons increase. We propose a closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback. In AdaPlanner, the LLM agent adaptively refines its plan from feedback with both in-plan and out-of-plan refinement strategies. To mitigate hallucination, we develop a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a skill discovery mechanism that leverages successful plans as few-shot exemplars, enabling the agent to plan and refine with fewer task demonstrations. Our experiments in the ALFWorld and MiniWoB++ environments demonstrate that AdaPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 3.73% and 4.11% while utilizing 2x and 600x fewer samples, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16653v1

To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%).

Symbolic planners, on the other hand, may encounter execution errors due to their common assumption of complete domain knowledge which is hard to manually prepare for an open-world setting. In this paper, we introduce a Language-Augmented Symbolic Planner (LASP) that integrates pre-trained LLMs to enable conventional symbolic planners to operate in an open-world environment where only incomplete knowledge of action preconditions, objects, and properties is initially available. In case of execution errors, LASP can utilize the LLM to diagnose the cause of the error based on the observation and interact with the environment to incrementally build up its knowledge base necessary for accomplishing the given tasks.

Affordances-Oriented Planning using Foundation Models for Continuous Vision-Language Navigation,"Jiaqi Chen, Bingqian Lin, Xinmin Liu, Xiaodan Liang, Kwan-Yee K.

However, these zero-shot methods focus only on solving high-level task planning by selecting nodes in predefined navigation graphs for movements, overlooking low-level control in realistic navigation scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose AO-Planner, a novel affordances-oriented planning framework for continuous VLN task. Our AO-Planner integrates various foundation models to achieve affordances-oriented motion planning and action decision-making, both performed in a zero-shot manner. Specifically, we employ a visual affordances prompting (VAP) approach, where visible ground is segmented utilizing SAM to provide navigational affordances, based on which the LLM selects potential next waypoints and generates low-level path planning towards selected waypoints. We further introduce a high-level agent, PathAgent, to identify the most probable pixel-based path and convert it into 3D coordinates to fulfill low-level motion. Experimental results on the challenging R2R-CE benchmark demonstrate that AO-Planner achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance (5.5% improvement in SPL).

Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or VLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we introduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent empowered by pre-trained neural networks.

To quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to clear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object states into consideration.

TwoStep: Multi-agent Task Planning using Classical Planners and Large Language Models,"Ishika Singh, David Traum, Jesse Thomason",2024-03-25,"Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, for example that two agents in the domain can execute an action simultaneously if postconditions of each do not interfere with preconditions of the other. A human expert can decompose a goal into largely independent constituent parts and assign each agent to one of these subgoals to take advantage of simultaneous actions for faster execution of plan steps, each using only single agent planning. By contrast, large language models (LLMs) used for directly inferring plan steps do not guarantee execution success, but do leverage commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. We combine the strengths of classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for two-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone and preserving execution success. Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of subgoals can achieve similar multi-agent execution steps than those specified by human experts.

Recently, LLMs have been applied in robotics task planning, particularly using a code generation approach that converts complex high-level instructions into mid-level policy codes. In contrast, our approach acquires text descriptions of the task and scene objects, then formulates task planning through natural language reasoning, and outputs coordinate level control commands, thus reducing the necessity for intermediate representation code as policies with pre-defined APIs. Our approach is evaluated on a multi-modal prompt simulation benchmark, demonstrating that our prompt engineering experiments with natural language reasoning significantly enhance success rates compared to its absence. Furthermore, our approach illustrates the potential for natural language descriptions to transfer robotics skills from known tasks to previously unseen tasks.

These domain-specific and labor-intensive modules are limited in addressing emerging tasks in real-world settings. Here, we present LLM^3, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based TAMP framework featuring a domain-independent interface. Specifically, we leverage the powerful reasoning and planning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to propose symbolic action sequences and select continuous action parameters for motion planning. Crucially, LLM^3 incorporates motion planning feedback through prompting, allowing the LLM to iteratively refine its proposals by reasoning about motion failure. Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion planning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain-specific messages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP problems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters.

Safe Task Planning for Language-Instructed Multi-Robot Systems using Conformal Prediction,"Jun Wang, Guocheng He, Yiannis Kantaros",2024-02-23,"This paper addresses task planning problems for language-instructed robot teams. Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to apply their capabilities at various locations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack mission completion guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a new decentralized LLM-based planner, called S-ATLAS for Safe plAnning for Teams of Language-instructed AgentS, that is capable of achieving user-defined mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent uncertainty in a decentralized fashion, enabling robots to make individual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve user-specified task success rates while minimizing the overall number of help requests.

AutoGPT+P: Affordance-based Task Planning with Large Language Models,"Timo Birr, Christoph Pohl, Abdelrahman Younes, Tamim Asfour",2024-02-16,"Recent advances in task planning leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve generalizability by combining such models with classical planning algorithms to address their inherent limitations in reasoning capabilities. However, these approaches face the challenge of dynamically capturing the initial state of the task planning problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose AutoGPT+P, a system that combines an affordance-based scene representation with a planning system. Affordances encompass the action possibilities of an agent on the environment and objects present in it. Thus, deriving the planning domain from an affordance-based scene representation allows symbolic planning with arbitrary objects. AutoGPT+P leverages this representation to derive and execute a plan for a task specified by the user in natural language. In addition to solving planning tasks under a closed-world assumption, AutoGPT+P can also handle planning with incomplete information, e. g., tasks with missing objects by exploring the scene, suggesting alternatives, or providing a partial plan. The affordance-based scene representation combines object detection with an automatically generated object-affordance-mapping using ChatGPT. The core planning tool extends existing work by automatically correcting semantic and syntactic errors. Our approach achieves a success rate of 98%, surpassing the current 81% success rate of the current state-of-the-art LLM-based planning method SayCan on the SayCan instruction set. Furthermore, we evaluated our approach on our newly created dataset with 150 scenarios covering a wide range of complex tasks with missing objects, achieving a success rate of 79% on our dataset.

The proposed approach uses LLM to generate a number of task plans as trees and amalgamates them into a graph by removing questionable paths. Then an optimal task tree can be retrieved to circumvent questionable and high-cost nodes, thereby improving planning accuracy and execution efficiency.

To this end, we introduce Robotic Vision-Language Planning (ViLa), a novel approach for long-horizon robotic planning that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate a sequence of actionable steps. ViLa directly integrates perceptual data into its reasoning and planning process, enabling a profound understanding of commonsense knowledge in the visual world, including spatial layouts and object attributes.

To address the problem, we propose a RoboGPT agent\footnote{our code and dataset will be released soon} for making embodied long-term decisions for daily tasks, with two modules: 1) LLMs-based planning with re-plan to break the task into multiple sub-goals; 2) RoboSkill individually designed for sub-goals to learn better navigation and manipulation skills.

Distilling and Retrieving Generalizable Knowledge for Robot Manipulation via Language Corrections,"Lihan Zha, Yuchen Cui, Li-Heng Lin, Minae Kwon, Montserrat Gonzalez Arenas, Andy Zeng, Fei Xia, Dorsa Sadigh",2023-11-17,"Today's robot policies exhibit subpar performance when faced with the challenge of generalizing to novel environments. Human corrective feedback is a crucial form of guidance to enable such generalization. However, adapting to and learning from online human corrections is a non-trivial endeavor: not only do robots need to remember human feedback over time to retrieve the right information in new settings and reduce the intervention rate, but also they would need to be able to respond to feedback that can be arbitrary corrections about high-level human preferences to low-level adjustments to skill parameters. In this work, we present Distillation and Retrieval of Online Corrections (DROC), a large language model (LLM)-based system that can respond to arbitrary forms of language feedback, distill generalizable knowledge from corrections, and retrieve relevant past experiences based on textual and visual similarity for improving performance in novel settings. DROC is able to respond to a sequence of online language corrections that address failures in both high-level task plans and low-level skill primitives. We demonstrate that DROC effectively distills the relevant information from the sequence of online corrections in a knowledge base and retrieves that knowledge in settings with new task or object instances. DROC outperforms other techniques that directly generate robot code via LLMs by using only half of the total number of corrections needed in the first round and requires little to no corrections after two iterations.

Kinematic-aware Prompting for Generalizable Articulated Object Manipulation with LLMs,"Wenke Xia, Dong Wang, Xincheng Pang, Zhigang Wang, Bin Zhao, Di Hu, Xuelong Li",2023-11-06,"Generalizable articulated object manipulation is essential for home-assistant robots. Recent efforts focus on imitation learning from demonstrations or reinforcement learning in simulation, however, due to the prohibitive costs of real-world data collection and precise object simulation, it still remains challenging for these works to achieve broad adaptability across diverse articulated objects. Recently, many works have tried to utilize the strong in-context learning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve generalizable robotic manipulation, but most of these researches focus on high-level task planning, sidelining low-level robotic control. In this work, building on the idea that the kinematic structure of the object determines how we can manipulate it, we propose a kinematic-aware prompting framework that prompts LLMs with kinematic knowledge of objects to generate low-level motion trajectory waypoints, supporting various object manipulation. To effectively prompt LLMs with the kinematic structure of different objects, we design a unified kinematic knowledge parser, which represents various articulated objects as a unified textual description containing kinematic joints and contact location. Building upon this unified description, a kinematic-aware planner model is proposed to generate precise 3D manipulation waypoints via a designed kinematic-aware chain-of-thoughts prompting method.

Graule, Volkan Isler",2023-10-30,"A robot in a human-centric environment needs to account for the human's intent and future motion in its task and motion planning to ensure safe and effective operation. This requires symbolic reasoning about probable future actions and the ability to tie these actions to specific locations in the physical environment.

More importantly, the resulting models are constrained to specific data formats and modalities. Moreover, connecting predictions from such models to the environment at hand to ensure the applicability of these predictions is an unsolved problem. We present a system that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to infer a human's next actions from a range of modalities without fine-tuning. A novel aspect of our system that is critical to robotics applications is that it links the predicted actions to specific locations in a semantic map of the environment. Our method leverages the fact that LLMs, trained on a vast corpus of text describing typical human behaviors, encode substantial world knowledge, including probable sequences of human actions and activities.

Tree-Planner: Efficient Close-loop Task Planning with Large Language Models,"Mengkang Hu, Yao Mu, Xinmiao Yu, Mingyu Ding, Shiguang Wu, Wenqi Shao, Qiguang Chen, Bin Wang, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo",2023-10-12,"This paper studies close-loop task planning, which refers to the process of generating a sequence of skills (a plan) to accomplish a specific goal while adapting the plan based on real-time observations. Recently, prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalent paradigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, this paradigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundant error correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testing and applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, which reframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling, action tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by using an LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by the aggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs a top-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-time environmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposing LLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-deciding calls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedly consumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2% compared to the previously best-performing model.

However, task plans generated by LLMs often lack feasibility and correctness. To address this challenge, we introduce ISR-LLM, a novel framework that improves LLM-based planning through an iterative self-refinement process. The framework operates through three sequential steps: preprocessing, planning, and iterative self-refinement. During preprocessing, an LLM translator is employed to convert natural language input into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) formulation. In the planning phase, an LLM planner formulates an initial plan, which is then assessed and refined in the iterative self-refinement step by using a validator. We examine the performance of ISR-LLM across three distinct planning domains. The results show that ISR-LLM is able to achieve markedly higher success rates in task accomplishments compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planners. Moreover, it also preserves the broad applicability and generalizability of working with natural language instructions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13724v1
SayPlan: Grounding Large Language Models using 3D Scene Graphs for Scalable Robot Task Planning,"Krishan Rana, Jesse Haviland, Sourav Garg, Jad Abou-Chakra, Ian Reid, Niko Suenderhauf",2023-07-12,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results in developing generalist planning agents for diverse tasks. However, grounding these plans in expansive, multi-floor, and multi-room environments presents a significant challenge for robotics. We introduce SayPlan, a scalable approach to LLM-based, large-scale task planning for robotics using 3D scene graph (3DSG) representations. To ensure the scalability of our approach, we: (1) exploit the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs to allow LLMs to conduct a 'semantic search' for task-relevant subgraphs from a smaller, collapsed representation of the full graph; (2) reduce the planning horizon for the LLM by integrating a classical path planner and (3) introduce an 'iterative replanning' pipeline that refines the initial plan using feedback from a scene graph simulator, correcting infeasible actions and avoiding planning failures. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale environments spanning up to 3 floors and 36 rooms with 140 assets and objects and show that our approach is capable of grounding large-scale, long-horizon task plans from abstract, and natural language instruction for a mobile manipulator robot to execute.

RoCo: Dialectic Multi-Robot Collaboration with Large Language Models,"Zhao Mandi, Shreeya Jain, Shuran Song",2023-07-10,"We propose a novel approach to multi-robot collaboration that harnesses the power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for both high-level communication and low-level path planning. Robots are equipped with LLMs to discuss and collectively reason task strategies. They then generate sub-task plans and task space waypoint paths, which are used by a multi-arm motion planner to accelerate trajectory planning. We also provide feedback from the environment, such as collision checking, and prompt the LLM agents to improve their plan and waypoints in-context. For evaluation, we introduce RoCoBench, a 6-task benchmark covering a wide range of multi-robot collaboration scenarios, accompanied by a text-only dataset for agent representation and reasoning. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach -- it achieves high success rates across all tasks in RoCoBench and adapts to variations in task semantics. Our dialog setup offers high interpretability and flexibility -- in real world experiments, we show RoCo easily incorporates human-in-the-loop, where a user can communicate and collaborate with a robot agent to complete tasks together.

Embodied Task Planning with Large Language Models,"Zhenyu Wu, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Jiwen Lu, Haibin Yan",2023-07-04,"Equipping embodied agents with commonsense is important for robots to successfully complete complex human instructions in general environments. Recent large language models (LLM) can embed rich semantic knowledge for agents in plan generation of complex tasks, while they lack the information about the realistic world and usually yield infeasible action sequences. In this paper, we propose a TAsk Planing Agent (TaPA) in embodied tasks for grounded planning with physical scene constraint, where the agent generates executable plans according to the existed objects in the scene by aligning LLMs with the visual perception models. Specifically, we first construct a multimodal dataset containing triplets of indoor scenes, instructions and action plans, where we provide the designed prompts and the list of existing objects in the scene for GPT-3.5 to generate a large number of instructions and corresponding planned actions. The generated data is leveraged for grounded plan tuning of pre-trained LLMs. During inference, we discover the objects in the scene by extending open-vocabulary object detectors to multi-view RGB images collected in different achievable locations. Experimental results show that the generated plan from our TaPA framework can achieve higher success rate than LLaVA and GPT-3.5 by a sizable margin, which indicates the practicality of embodied task planning in general and complex environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01848v1
Robot Task Planning Based on Large Language Model Representing Knowledge with Directed Graph Structures,"Yue Zhen, Sheng Bi, Lu Xing-tong, Pan Wei-qin, Shi Hai-peng, Chen Zi-rui, Fang Yi-shu",2023-06-08,"Traditional robot task planning methods face challenges when dealing with highly unstructured environments and complex tasks. We propose a task planning method that combines human expertise with an LLM and have designed an LLM prompt template, Think_Net_Prompt, with stronger expressive power to represent structured professional knowledge. We further propose a method to progressively decompose tasks and generate a task tree to reduce the planning volume for each task, and we have designed a strategy to decouple robot task planning. By dividing different planning entities and separating the task from the actual machine binding process, the task planning process becomes more flexible. Research results show that our method performs well in handling specified code formats, understanding the relationship between tasks and subtasks, and extracting parameters from text descriptions. However, there are also problems such as limited complexity of task logic handling, ambiguity in the quantity of parts and the precise location of assembly. Improving the precision of task description and cognitive structure can bring certain improvements. https://github.com/NOMIzy/Think_Net_Prompt",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05171v1
AlphaBlock: Embodied Finetuning for Vision-Language Reasoning in Robot Manipulation,"Chuhao Jin, Wenhui Tan, Jiange Yang, Bei Liu, Ruihua Song, Limin Wang, Jianlong Fu",2023-05-30,"We propose a novel framework for learning high-level cognitive capabilities in robot manipulation tasks, such as making a smiley face using building blocks. These tasks often involve complex multi-step reasoning, presenting significant challenges due to the limited paired data connecting human instructions (e.g., making a smiley face) and robot actions (e.g., end-effector movement). Existing approaches relieve this challenge by adopting an open-loop paradigm decomposing high-level instructions into simple sub-task plans, and executing them step-by-step using low-level control models. However, these approaches are short of instant observations in multi-step reasoning, leading to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose to automatically collect a cognitive robot dataset by Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting dataset AlphaBlock consists of 35 comprehensive high-level tasks of multi-step text plans and paired observation sequences. To enable efficient data acquisition, we employ elaborated multi-round prompt designs that effectively reduce the burden of extensive human involvement. We further propose a closed-loop multi-modal embodied planning model that autoregressively generates plans by taking image observations as input. To facilitate effective learning, we leverage MiniGPT-4 with a frozen visual encoder and LLM, and finetune additional vision adapter and Q-former to enable fine-grained spatial perception for manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments to verify the superiority over existing open and closed-loop methods, and achieve a significant increase in success rate by 21.4% and 14.5% over ChatGPT and GPT-4 based robot tasks.

Integrating Action Knowledge and LLMs for Task Planning and Situation Handling in Open Worlds,"Yan Ding, Xiaohan Zhang, Saeid Amiri, Nieqing Cao, Hao Yang, Andy Kaminski, Chad Esselink, Shiqi Zhang",2023-05-27,"Task planning systems have been developed to help robots use human knowledge (about actions) to complete long-horizon tasks. Most of them have been developed for ""closed worlds"" while assuming the robot is provided with complete world knowledge. However, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break the planner's completeness. Could we leverage the recent advances on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable classical planning systems to deal with novel situations?   This paper introduces a novel framework, called COWP, for open-world task planning and situation handling. COWP dynamically augments the robot's action knowledge, including the preconditions and effects of actions, with task-oriented commonsense knowledge. COWP embraces the openness from LLMs, and is grounded to specific domains via action knowledge. For systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 1,085 execution-time situations. Each situation corresponds to a state instance wherein a robot is potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks. Additionally, we have demonstrated COWP using a mobile manipulator. Supplementary materials are available at: https://cowplanning.github.io/",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17590v2
Large Language Models as Commonsense Knowledge for Large-Scale Task Planning,"Zirui Zhao, Wee Sun Lee, David Hsu",2023-05-23,"Large-scale task planning is a major challenge. Recent work exploits large language models (LLMs) directly as a policy and shows surprisingly interesting results. This paper shows that LLMs provide a commonsense model of the world in addition to a policy that acts on it. The world model and the policy can be combined in a search algorithm, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to scale up task planning. In our new LLM-MCTS algorithm, the LLM-induced world model provides a commonsense prior belief for MCTS to achieve effective reasoning; the LLM-induced policy acts as a heuristic to guide the search, vastly improving search efficiency. Experiments show that LLM-MCTS outperforms both MCTS alone and policies induced by LLMs (GPT2 and GPT3.5) by a wide margin, for complex, novel tasks. Further experiments and analyses on multiple tasks -- multiplication, multi-hop travel planning, object rearrangement -- suggest minimum description length (MDL) as a general guiding principle: if the description length of the world model is substantially smaller than that of the policy, using LLM as a world model for model-based planning is likely better than using LLM solely as a policy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14078v2

Our method grounds the input of the LLM on the domain that is represented as a scene graph, enabling it to translate human requests into executable robot plans, thereby learning to reason over long-horizon tasks, as encountered in the ALFRED benchmark. We compare our approach with classical planning and baseline methods to examine the applicability and generalizability of LLM-based planners.

Towards autonomous system: flexible modular production system enhanced with large language model agents,"Yuchen Xia, Manthan Shenoy, Nasser Jazdi, Michael Weyrich",2023-04-28,"In this paper, we present a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs), digital twins and industrial automation system to enable intelligent planning and control of production processes. We retrofit the automation system for a modular production facility and create executable control interfaces of fine-granular functionalities and coarse-granular skills. Low-level functionalities are executed by automation components, and high-level skills are performed by automation modules. Subsequently, a digital twin system is developed, registering these interfaces and containing additional descriptive information about the production system. Based on the retrofitted automation system and the created digital twins, LLM-agents are designed to interpret descriptive information in the digital twins and control the physical system through service interfaces. These LLM-agents serve as intelligent agents on different levels within an automation system, enabling autonomous planning and control of flexible production. Given a task instruction as input, the LLM-agents orchestrate a sequence of atomic functionalities and skills to accomplish the task. We demonstrate how our implemented prototype can handle un-predefined tasks, plan a production process, and execute the operations. This research highlights the potential of integrating LLMs into industrial automation systems in the context of smart factory for more agile, flexible, and adaptive production processes, while it also underscores the critical insights and limitations for future work.

A Framework for Neurosymbolic Robot Action Planning using Large Language Models,"Alessio Capitanelli, Fulvio Mastrogiovanni",2023-03-01,"Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy due to its ease of understanding and deployment in robot architectures. However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in real-world, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance in complex planning domains or when frequent re-planning is needed. We present a framework, Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs' response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the output, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of end-to-end, making each action available for execution as soon as it is generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn enables concurrent planning and execution. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted by the research community to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to provide an overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities to build a look-ahead predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000 samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by up to 61.4%",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00438v3
CAPE: Corrective Actions from Precondition Errors using Large Language Models,"Shreyas Sundara Raman, Vanya Cohen, Ifrah Idrees, Eric Rosen, Ray Mooney, Stefanie Tellex, David Paulius",2022-11-17,"Extracting commonsense knowledge from a large language model (LLM) offers a path to designing intelligent robots. Existing approaches that leverage LLMs for planning are unable to recover when an action fails and often resort to retrying failed actions, without resolving the error's underlying cause. We propose a novel approach (CAPE) that attempts to propose corrective actions to resolve precondition errors during planning. CAPE improves the quality of generated plans by leveraging few-shot reasoning from action preconditions. Our approach enables embodied agents to execute more tasks than baseline methods while ensuring semantic correctness and minimizing re-prompting. In VirtualHome, CAPE generates executable plans while improving a human-annotated plan correctness metric from 28.89% to 49.63% over SayCan. Our improvements transfer to a Boston Dynamics Spot robot initialized with a set of skills (specified in language) and associated preconditions, where CAPE improves the correctness metric of the executed task plans by 76.49% compared to SayCan. Our approach enables the robot to follow natural language commands and robustly recover from failures, which baseline approaches largely cannot resolve or address inefficiently.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09935v3
ProgPrompt: Generating Situated Robot Task Plans using Large Language Models,"Ishika Singh, Valts Blukis, Arsalan Mousavian, Ankit Goyal, Danfei Xu, Jonathan Tremblay, Dieter Fox, Jesse Thomason, Animesh Garg",2022-09-22,"Task planning can require defining myriad domain knowledge about the world in which a robot needs to act. To ameliorate that effort, large language models (LLMs) can be used to score potential next actions during task planning, and even generate action sequences directly, given an instruction in natural language with no additional domain information. However, such methods either require enumerating all possible next steps for scoring, or generate free-form text that may contain actions not possible on a given robot in its current context. We present a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation functional across situated environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. Our key insight is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, as well as with example programs that can be executed. We make concrete recommendations about prompt structure and generation constraints through ablation experiments, demonstrate state of the art success rates in VirtualHome household tasks, and deploy our method on a physical robot arm for tabletop tasks.

Ryoo, Austin Stone, Daniel Kappler",2022-09-20,"Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked new capabilities of task planning from human instructions. However, prior attempts to apply LLMs to real-world robotic tasks are limited by the lack of grounding in the surrounding scene. In this paper, we develop NLMap, an open-vocabulary and queryable scene representation to address this problem. NLMap serves as a framework to gather and integrate contextual information into LLM planners, allowing them to see and query available objects in the scene before generating a context-conditioned plan. NLMap first establishes a natural language queryable scene representation with Visual Language models (VLMs). An LLM based object proposal module parses instructions and proposes involved objects to query the scene representation for object availability and location. An LLM planner then plans with such information about the scene. NLMap allows robots to operate without a fixed list of objects nor executable options, enabling real robot operation unachievable by previous methods.

DStruct2Design: Data and Benchmarks for Data Structure Driven Generative Floor Plan Design,"Zhi Hao Luo, Luis Lara, Ge Ya Luo, Florian Golemo, Christopher Beckham, Christopher Pal",2024-07-22,"Text conditioned generative models for images have yielded impressive results. Text conditioned floorplan generation as a special type of raster image generation task also received particular attention. However there are many use cases in floorpla generation where numerical properties of the generated result are more important than the aesthetics. For instance, one might want to specify sizes for certain rooms in a floorplan and compare the generated floorplan with given specifications Current approaches, datasets and commonly used evaluations do not support these kinds of constraints. As such, an attractive strategy is to generate an intermediate data structure that contains numerical properties of a floorplan which can be used to generate the final floorplan image. To explore this setting we (1) construct a new dataset for this data-structure to data-structure formulation of floorplan generation using two popular image based floorplan datasets RPLAN and ProcTHOR-10k, and provide the tools to convert further procedurally generated ProcTHOR floorplan data into our format.

System-1.x: Learning to Balance Fast and Slow Planning with Language Models,"Swarnadeep Saha, Archiki Prasad, Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Peter Hase, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal",2024-07-19,"Language models can be used to solve long-horizon planning problems in two distinct modes: a fast 'System-1' mode, directly generating plans without any explicit search or backtracking, and a slow 'System-2' mode, planning step-by-step by explicitly searching over possible actions. While System-2 is typically more effective, it is also more computationally expensive, making it infeasible for long plans or large action spaces. Moreover, isolated System-1 or 2 ignores the user's end goals, failing to provide ways to control the model's behavior. To this end, we propose the System-1.x Planner, a controllable planning framework with LLMs that is capable of generating hybrid plans and balancing between the two planning modes based on the difficulty of the problem at hand. System-1.x consists of (i) a controller, (ii) a System-1 Planner, and (iii) a System-2 Planner. Based on a user-specified hybridization factor (x) governing the mixture between System-1 and 2, the controller decomposes a problem into sub-goals, and classifies them as easy or hard to be solved by either System-1 or 2, respectively. We fine-tune all three components on top of a single base LLM, requiring only search traces as supervision. Experiments with two diverse planning tasks -- Maze Navigation and Blocksworld -- show that our System-1.x Planner outperforms a System-1 Planner, a System-2 Planner trained to approximate A* search, and also a symbolic planner (A*). We demonstrate the following key properties of our planner: (1) controllability: increasing the hybridization factor (e.g., System-1.75 vs 1.5) performs more search, improving performance, (2) flexibility: by building a neuro-symbolic variant with a neural System-1 and a symbolic System-2, we can use existing symbolic methods, and (3) generalizability: by being able to learn from different search algorithms, our method is robust to the choice of search algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14414v1
KoMA: Knowledge-driven Multi-agent Framework for Autonomous Driving with Large Language Models,"Kemou Jiang, Xuan Cai, Zhiyong Cui, Aoyong Li, Yilong Ren, Haiyang Yu, Hao Yang, Daocheng Fu, Licheng Wen, Pinlong Cai",2024-07-19,"Large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents offer a novel avenue for tackling real-world challenges through a knowledge-driven manner.

However, the complexity of driving tasks often necessitates the collaboration of multiple, heterogeneous agents, underscoring the need for such LLM-driven agents to engage in cooperative knowledge sharing and cognitive synergy. Despite the promise of LLMs, current applications predominantly center around single agent scenarios. To broaden the horizons of knowledge-driven strategies and bolster the generalization capabilities of autonomous agents, we propose the KoMA framework consisting of multi-agent interaction, multi-step planning, shared-memory, and ranking-based reflection modules to enhance multi-agents' decision-making in complex driving scenarios. Based on the framework's generated text descriptions of driving scenarios, the multi-agent interaction module enables LLM agents to analyze and infer the intentions of surrounding vehicles, akin to human cognition. The multi-step planning module enables LLM agents to analyze and obtain final action decisions layer by layer to ensure consistent goals for short-term action decisions. The shared memory module can accumulate collective experience to make superior decisions, and the ranking-based reflection module can evaluate and improve agent behavior with the aim of enhancing driving safety and efficiency. The KoMA framework not only enhances the robustness and adaptability of autonomous driving agents but also significantly elevates their generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios.

To mitigate the risk of errors and missing edge cases, the concept of defeaters - arguments or evidence that challenge claims in an assurance case - has been introduced. Defeaters can provide timely detection of weaknesses in the arguments, prompting further investigation and timely mitigations. However, capturing defeaters relies on expert judgment, experience, and creativity and must be done iteratively due to evolving requirements and regulations. This paper proposes CoDefeater, an automated process to leverage large language models (LLMs) for finding defeaters. Initial results on two systems show that LLMs can efficiently find known and unforeseen feasible defeaters to support safety analysts in enhancing the completeness and confidence of assurance cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13717v1
PLANTS: A Novel Problem and Dataset for Summarization of Planning-Like (PL) Tasks,"Vishal Pallagani, Biplav Srivastava, Nitin Gupta",2024-07-18,"Text summarization is a well-studied problem that deals with deriving insights from unstructured text consumed by humans, and it has found extensive business applications. However, many real-life tasks involve generating a series of actions to achieve specific goals, such as workflows, recipes, dialogs, and travel plans. We refer to them as planning-like (PL) tasks noting that the main commonality they share is control flow information. which may be partially specified. Their structure presents an opportunity to create more practical summaries to help users make quick decisions. We investigate this observation by introducing a novel plan summarization problem, presenting a dataset, and providing a baseline method for generating PL summaries. Using quantitative metrics and qualitative user studies to establish baselines, we evaluate the plan summaries from our method and large language models.

"Retrieve, Summarize, Plan: Advancing Multi-hop Question Answering with an Iterative Approach","Zhouyu Jiang, Mengshu Sun, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang",2024-07-18,"Multi-hop question answering is a challenging task with distinct industrial relevance, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods based on large language models (LLMs) have become a popular approach to tackle this task. Owing to the potential inability to retrieve all necessary information in a single iteration, a series of iterative RAG methods has been recently developed, showing significant performance improvements. However, existing methods still face two critical challenges: context overload resulting from multiple rounds of retrieval, and over-planning and repetitive planning due to the lack of a recorded retrieval trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative RAG method called ReSP, equipped with a dual-function summarizer. This summarizer compresses information from retrieved documents, targeting both the overarching question and the current sub-question concurrently. Experimental results on the multi-hop question-answering datasets HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, and exhibits excellent robustness concerning context length.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13101v1
Towards Collaborative Intelligence: Propagating Intentions and Reasoning for Multi-Agent Coordination with Large Language Models,"Xihe Qiu, Haoyu Wang, Xiaoyu Tan, Chao Qu, Yujie Xiong, Yuan Cheng, Yinghui Xu, Wei Chu, Yuan Qi",2024-07-17,"Effective collaboration in multi-agent systems requires communicating goals and intentions between agents. Current agent frameworks often suffer from dependencies on single-agent execution and lack robust inter-module communication, frequently leading to suboptimal multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies and inadequate task coordination. To address these challenges, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as collaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL. Each agent maintains a private intention consisting of its current goal and associated sub-tasks. Agents broadcast their intentions periodically, allowing other agents to infer coordination tasks. A propagation network transforms broadcast intentions into teammate-specific communication messages, sharing relevant goals with designated teammates. The architecture of our framework is structured into planning, grounding, and execution modules. During execution, multiple agents interact in a downstream environment and communicate intentions to enable coordinated behaviors. The grounding module dynamically adapts comprehension strategies based on emerging coordination patterns, while feedback from execution agents influnces the planning module, enabling the dynamic re-planning of sub-tasks. Results in collaborative environment simulation demonstrate intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors by aligning sub-task dependencies between agents. Agents learn when to communicate intentions and which teammates require task details, resulting in emergent coordinated behaviors. This demonstrates the efficacy of intention sharing for cooperative multi-agent RL based on LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12532v1
What's Wrong? Refining Meeting Summaries with LLM Feedback,"Frederic Kirstein, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp",2024-07-16,"Meeting summarization has become a critical task since digital encounters have become a common practice. Large language models (LLMs) show great potential in summarization, offering enhanced coherence and context understanding compared to traditional methods. However, they still struggle to maintain relevance and avoid hallucination. We introduce a multi-LLM correction approach for meeting summarization using a two-phase process that mimics the human review process: mistake identification and summary refinement. We release QMSum Mistake, a dataset of 200 automatically generated meeting summaries annotated by humans on nine error types, including structural, omission, and irrelevance errors. Our experiments show that these errors can be identified with high accuracy by an LLM. We transform identified mistakes into actionable feedback to improve the quality of a given summary measured by relevance, informativeness, conciseness, and coherence. This post-hoc refinement effectively improves summary quality by leveraging multiple LLMs to validate output quality. Our multi-LLM approach for meeting summarization shows potential for similar complex text generation tasks requiring robustness, action planning, and discussion towards a goal.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11919v1
LOTUS: Enabling Semantic Queries with LLMs Over Tables of Unstructured and Structured Data,"Liana Patel, Siddharth Jha, Carlos Guestrin, Matei Zaharia",2024-07-16,"The semantic capabilities of language models (LMs) have the potential to enable rich analytics and reasoning over vast knowledge corpora. Unfortunately, existing systems lack high-level abstractions to perform semantic queries at scale. We introduce semantic operators, a declarative programming interface that extends the relational model with composable AI-based operations for semantic queries over datasets (e.g., sorting or aggregating records using natural language criteria). Each operator can be implemented and optimized in multiple ways, opening a rich space for execution plans similar to relational operators. We implement our operators and several optimizations for them in LOTUS, an open-source query engine with a Pandas-like API.   We demonstrate LOTUS' effectiveness across a series of real applications, including fact-checking, extreme multi-label classification, and search. We find that LOTUS' programming model is highly expressive, capturing state-of-the-art query pipelines with low development overhead. Specifically, on the FEVER dataset, LOTUS' programs can reproduce FacTool, a recent state-of-the-art fact-checking pipeline, in few lines of code, and implement a new pipeline that improves accuracy by $9.5\%$, while offering $7-34\times$ lower execution time. In the extreme multi-label classification task on the BioDEX dataset, LOTUS reproduces state-of-the art result quality with its join operator, while providing an efficient algorithm that runs $800\times$ faster than a naive join. In the search and ranking application, LOTUS allows a simple composition of operators to achieve $5.9 - 49.4\%$ higher nDCG@10 than the vanilla retriever and re-ranker, while also providing query efficiency, with $1.67 - 10\times$ lower execution time than LM-based ranking methods used by prior works.

LAB-Bench: Measuring Capabilities of Language Models for Biology Research,"Jon M. Laurent, Joseph D. Janizek, Michael Ruzo, Michaela M. Hinks, Michael J. Hammerling, Siddharth Narayanan, Manvitha Ponnapati, Andrew D. White, Samuel G. Rodriques",2024-07-14,"There is widespread optimism that frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-augmented systems have the potential to rapidly accelerate scientific discovery across disciplines. Today, many benchmarks exist to measure LLM knowledge and reasoning on textbook-style science questions, but few if any benchmarks are designed to evaluate language model performance on practical tasks required for scientific research, such as literature search, protocol planning, and data analysis. As a step toward building such benchmarks, we introduce the Language Agent Biology Benchmark (LAB-Bench), a broad dataset of over 2,400 multiple choice questions for evaluating AI systems on a range of practical biology research capabilities, including recall and reasoning over literature, interpretation of figures, access and navigation of databases, and comprehension and manipulation of DNA and protein sequences. Importantly, in contrast to previous scientific benchmarks, we expect that an AI system that can achieve consistently high scores on the more difficult LAB-Bench tasks would serve as a useful assistant for researchers in areas such as literature search and molecular cloning. As an initial assessment of the emergent scientific task capabilities of frontier language models, we measure performance of several against our benchmark and report results compared to human expert biology researchers. We will continue to update and expand LAB-Bench over time, and expect it to serve as a useful tool in the development of automated research systems going forward.

Revolutionizing Bridge Operation and maintenance with LLM-based Agents: An Overview of Applications and Insights,"Xinyu-Chen, Yanwen-Zhu, Yang-Hou, Lianzhen-Zhang",2024-07-14,"In various industrial fields of human social development, people have been exploring methods aimed at freeing human labor. Constructing LLM-based agents is considered to be one of the most effective tools to achieve this goal. Agent, as a kind of human-like intelligent entity with the ability of perception, planning, decision-making, and action, has created great production value in many fields. However, the bridge O\&M field shows a relatively low level of intelligence compared to other industries. Nevertheless, the bridge O\&M field has developed numerous intelligent inspection devices, machine learning algorithms, and autonomous evaluation and decision-making methods, which provide a feasible basis for breakthroughs in artificial intelligence in this field. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of AI bodies based on large-scale language models on the field of bridge O\&M and to analyze the potential challenges and opportunities it brings to the core tasks of bridge O\&M.

A Training Data Recipe to Accelerate A* Search with Language Models,"Devaansh Gupta, Boyang Li",2024-07-13,"Recent works in AI planning have proposed to combine LLMs with iterative tree-search algorithms like A* and MCTS, where LLMs are typically used to calculate the heuristic, guiding the planner towards the goal. However, combining these techniques is not trivial : LM-based heuristics are quite weak, incurring a high computational cost without a significant performance improvement. Existing methods to learn these heuristics do not consider the requirements of the planner, and typically need a lot of compute. Thus, in this work, we propose a distribution to downsample training data by identifying relevant data points to learn a performant heuristic, while constraining computational costs. To arrive at this model, we disentangle the requirements of the planner, in our case A* search, from that of the language model to generalise on this task. Surprisingly, we find an overlap between their requirements; A* requires more accurate predictions on nodes near the goal, and LMs need the same set of nodes for effective generalisation. With these insights, we can quantify the contribution of each node towards accelerating A* search, and subsequently derive a training distribution for learning LM-based heuristics. Following a recent work, we conduct our experiments on two classical planning domains, maze navigation and sokoban, with two test splits per domain, and two conventional loss functions. We reduce the number of iterations required to find the solutions by upto 13x, with a wall-clock speed-up of upto 5x.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09985v1
Language-Augmented Symbolic Planner for Open-World Task Planning,"Guanqi Chen, Lei Yang, Ruixing Jia, Zhe Hu, Yizhou Chen, Wei Zhang, Wenping Wang, Jia Pan",2024-07-13,"Enabling robotic agents to perform complex long-horizon tasks has been a long-standing goal in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the potential shown by large language models (LLMs), their planning capabilities remain limited to short-horizon tasks and they are unable to replace the symbolic planning approach. Symbolic planners, on the other hand, may encounter execution errors due to their common assumption of complete domain knowledge which is hard to manually prepare for an open-world setting. In this paper, we introduce a Language-Augmented Symbolic Planner (LASP) that integrates pre-trained LLMs to enable conventional symbolic planners to operate in an open-world environment where only incomplete knowledge of action preconditions, objects, and properties is initially available. In case of execution errors, LASP can utilize the LLM to diagnose the cause of the error based on the observation and interact with the environment to incrementally build up its knowledge base necessary for accomplishing the given tasks. Experiments demonstrate that LASP is proficient in solving planning problems in the open-world setting, performing well even in situations where there are multiple gaps in the knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09792v1
Instruction Following with Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning in Virtual Environments,"Zoya Volovikova, Alexey Skrynnik, Petr Kuderov, Aleksandr I.

In our framework, we assume that these instructions involve intricate linguistic structures and multiple interdependent tasks that must be navigated successfully to achieve the desired outcomes. To effectively manage these complexities, we propose a hierarchical framework that combines the deep language comprehension of large language models with the adaptive action-execution capabilities of reinforcement learning agents. The language module (based on LLM) translates the language instruction into a high-level action plan, which is then executed by a pre-trained reinforcement learning agent. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in two different environments: in IGLU, where agents are instructed to build structures, and in Crafter, where agents perform tasks and interact with objects in the surrounding environment according to language commands.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09287v1
STD-LLM: Understanding Both Spatial and Temporal Properties of Spatial-Temporal Data with LLMs,"Yiheng Huang, Xiaowei Mao, Shengnan Guo, Yubin Chen, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan",2024-07-12,"Spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation are important for real-world dynamic systems such as intelligent transportation, urban planning, and public health. Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their development in understanding spatial-temporal data has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-LLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{LLM}s, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-LLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers as well as virtual nodes. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for LLMs to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data. Additionally, to capture the non-pairwise and higher-order correlations, we design a hypergraph learning module for LLMs, which can enhance the overall performance and improve efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-LLM exhibits strong performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-LLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot learning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09096v1
Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Reactive Planning with Large Language Models,"Rohan Sinha, Amine Elhafsi, Christopher Agia, Matthew Foutter, Edward Schmerling, Marco Pavone",2024-07-11,"Foundation models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), trained on internet-scale data possess zero-shot generalization capabilities that make them a promising technology towards detecting and mitigating out-of-distribution failure modes of robotic systems. Fully realizing this promise, however, poses two challenges: (i) mitigating the considerable computational expense of these models such that they may be applied online, and (ii) incorporating their judgement regarding potential anomalies into a safe control framework. In this work, we present a two-stage reasoning framework: First is a fast binary anomaly classifier that analyzes observations in an LLM embedding space, which may then trigger a slower fallback selection stage that utilizes the reasoning capabilities of generative LLMs. These stages correspond to branch points in a model predictive control strategy that maintains the joint feasibility of continuing along various fallback plans to account for the slow reasoner's latency as soon as an anomaly is detected, thus ensuring safety. We show that our fast anomaly classifier outperforms autoregressive reasoning with state-of-the-art GPT models, even when instantiated with relatively small language models. This enables our runtime monitor to improve the trustworthiness of dynamic robotic systems, such as quadrotors or autonomous vehicles, under resource and time constraints.

GTA: A Benchmark for General Tool Agents,"Jize Wang, Zerun Ma, Yining Li, Songyang Zhang, Cailian Chen, Kai Chen, Xinyi Le",2024-07-11,"Significant focus has been placed on integrating large language models (LLMs) with various tools in developing general-purpose agents. This poses a challenge to LLMs' tool-use capabilities. However, there are evident gaps between existing tool-use evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only interactions, failing to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for General Tool Agents, featuring three main aspects: (i) Real user queries: human-written queries with simple real-world objectives but implicit tool-use, requiring the LLM to reason the suitable tools and plan the solution steps. (ii) Real deployed tools: an evaluation platform equipped with tools across perception, operation, logic, and creativity categories to evaluate the agents' actual task execution performance. (iii) Real multimodal inputs: authentic image files, such as spatial scenes, web page screenshots, tables, code snippets, and printed/handwritten materials, used as the query contexts to align with real-world scenarios closely. We design 229 real-world tasks and executable tool chains to evaluate mainstream LLMs. Our findings show that real-world user queries are challenging for existing LLMs, with GPT-4 completing less than 50% of the tasks and most LLMs achieving below 25%. This evaluation reveals the bottlenecks in the tool-use capabilities of current LLMs in real-world scenarios, which provides future direction for advancing general-purpose tool agents.

Incorporating Large Language Models into Production Systems for Enhanced Task Automation and Flexibility,"Yuchen Xia, Jize Zhang, Nasser Jazdi, Michael Weyrich",2024-07-11,"This paper introduces a novel approach to integrating large language model (LLM) agents into automated production systems, aimed at enhancing task automation and flexibility. We organize production operations within a hierarchical framework based on the automation pyramid. Atomic operation functionalities are modeled as microservices, which are executed through interface invocation within a dedicated digital twin system. This allows for a scalable and flexible foundation for orchestrating production processes. In this digital twin system, low-level, hardware-specific data is semantically enriched and made interpretable for LLMs for production planning and control tasks. Large language model agents are systematically prompted to interpret these production-specific data and knowledge. Upon receiving a user request or identifying a triggering event, the LLM agents generate a process plan. This plan is then decomposed into a series of atomic operations, executed as microservices within the real-world automation system. We implement this overall approach on an automated modular production facility at our laboratory, demonstrating how the LLMs can handle production planning and control tasks through a concrete case study. This results in an intuitive production facility with higher levels of task automation and flexibility. Finally, we reveal the several limitations in realizing the full potential of the large language models in autonomous systems and point out promising benefits.

We introduce the Theory of Mind module that scaffolds the high-level planning process by generating hypotheses about other agents' strategies in natural language. It then evaluates and iteratively refines these hypotheses by reinforcing hypotheses that make correct predictions about the other agents' behavior. Hypothetical Minds significantly improves performance over previous LLM-agent and RL baselines on a range of competitive, mixed motive, and collaborative domains in the Melting Pot benchmark, including both dyadic and population-based environments.

Optimal Decision Making Through Scenario Simulations Using Large Language Models,"Sumedh Rasal, E. J. Hauer",2024-07-09,"The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has markedly expanded their application across diverse domains, transforming how complex problems are approached and solved. Initially conceived to predict subsequent words in texts, these models have transcended their original design to comprehend and respond to the underlying contexts of queries. Today, LLMs routinely perform tasks that once seemed formidable, such as writing essays, poems, stories, and even developing software code. As their capabilities continue to grow, so too do the expectations of their performance in even more sophisticated domains.   Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring intricate decision-making, such as planning trips or choosing among multiple viable options. These tasks often demand a nuanced understanding of various outcomes and the ability to predict the consequences of different choices, which are currently outside the typical operational scope of LLMs.   This paper proposes an innovative approach to bridge this capability gap. By enabling LLMs to request multiple potential options and their respective parameters from users, our system introduces a dynamic framework that integrates an optimization function within the decision-making process. This function is designed to analyze the provided options, simulate potential outcomes, and determine the most advantageous solution based on a set of predefined criteria. By harnessing this methodology, LLMs can offer tailored, optimal solutions to complex, multi-variable problems, significantly enhancing their utility and effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach not only expands the functional envelope of LLMs but also paves the way for more autonomous and intelligent systems capable of supporting sophisticated decision-making tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06486v2

Algorithmic Language Models with Neurally Compiled Libraries,"Lucas Saldyt, Subbarao Kambhampati",2024-07-06,"Important tasks such as reasoning and planning are fundamentally algorithmic, meaning that solving them robustly requires acquiring true reasoning or planning algorithms, rather than shortcuts. Large Language Models lack true algorithmic ability primarily because of the limitations of neural network optimization algorithms, their optimization data and optimization objective, but also due to architectural inexpressivity. To solve this, our paper proposes augmenting LLMs with a library of fundamental operations and sophisticated differentiable programs, so that common algorithms do not need to be learned from scratch. We add memory, registers, basic operations, and adaptive recurrence to a transformer architecture built on LLaMA3. Then, we define a method for directly compiling algorithms into a differentiable starting library, which is used natively and propagates gradients for optimization.

This raises questions. Do such models know that they are LLMs and reliably act on this knowledge? Are they aware of their current circumstances, such as being deployed to the public? We refer to a model's knowledge of itself and its circumstances as situational awareness. To quantify situational awareness in LLMs, we introduce a range of behavioral tests, based on question answering and instruction following. These tests form the $\textbf{Situational Awareness Dataset (SAD)}$, a benchmark comprising 7 task categories and over 13,000 questions. The benchmark tests numerous abilities, including the capacity of LLMs to (i) recognize their own generated text, (ii) predict their own behavior, (iii) determine whether a prompt is from internal evaluation or real-world deployment, and (iv) follow instructions that depend on self-knowledge.   We evaluate 16 LLMs on SAD, including both base (pretrained) and chat models. While all models perform better than chance, even the highest-scoring model (Claude 3 Opus) is far from a human baseline on certain tasks. We also observe that performance on SAD is only partially predicted by metrics of general knowledge (e.g. MMLU). Chat models, which are finetuned to serve as AI assistants, outperform their corresponding base models on SAD but not on general knowledge tasks. The purpose of SAD is to facilitate scientific understanding of situational awareness in LLMs by breaking it down into quantitative abilities. Situational awareness is important because it enhances a model's capacity for autonomous planning and action. While this has potential benefits for automation, it also introduces novel risks related to AI safety and control.

Controllability requires the CAs to follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs), such as verifying identity before activating credit cards. Proactivity requires the CAs to guide the conversation towards the goal during user uncooperation, such as persuasive dialogue. Existing research cannot be unified with controllability, proactivity, and low manual annotation. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework for planning-based conversational agents (PCA) powered by large language models (LLMs), which only requires humans to define tasks and goals for the LLMs. Before conversation, LLM plans the core and necessary SOP for dialogue offline. During the conversation, LLM plans the best action path online referring to the SOP, and generates responses to achieve process controllability. Subsequently, we propose a semi-automatic dialogue data creation framework and curate a high-quality dialogue dataset (PCA-D). Meanwhile, we develop multiple variants and evaluation metrics for PCA, e.g., planning with Monte Carlo Tree Search (PCA-M), which searches for the optimal dialogue action while satisfying SOP constraints and achieving the proactive of the dialogue. Experiment results show that LLMs finetuned on PCA-D can significantly improve the performance and generalize to unseen domains.

First, generated PDDL code is typically evaluated using planning validators that check whether the problem can be solved with a planner. This method is insufficient because a language model might generate valid PDDL code that does not align with the natural language description of the task. Second, existing evaluation sets often have natural language descriptions of the planning task that closely resemble the ground truth PDDL, reducing the challenge of the task. To bridge this gap, we introduce \benchmarkName, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to generate PDDL code from natural language descriptions of planning tasks. We begin by creating a PDDL equivalence algorithm that rigorously evaluates the correctness of PDDL code generated by language models by flexibly comparing it against a ground truth PDDL. Then, we present a dataset of $132,037$ text-to-PDDL pairs across 13 different tasks, with varying levels of difficulty. Finally, we evaluate several API-access and open-weight language models that reveal this task's complexity. For example, $87.6\%$ of the PDDL problem descriptions generated by GPT-4o are syntactically parseable, $82.2\%$ are valid, solve-able problems, but only $35.1\%$ are semantically correct, highlighting the need for a more rigorous benchmark for this problem.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03321v1
Commonsense Reasoning for Legged Robot Adaptation with Vision-Language Models,"Annie S. Chen, Alec M. Lessing, Andy Tang, Govind Chada, Laura Smith, Sergey Levine, Chelsea Finn",2024-07-02,"Legged robots are physically capable of navigating a diverse variety of environments and overcoming a wide range of obstructions. For example, in a search and rescue mission, a legged robot could climb over debris, crawl through gaps, and navigate out of dead ends. However, the robot's controller needs to respond intelligently to such varied obstacles, and this requires handling unexpected and unusual scenarios successfully. This presents an open challenge to current learning methods, which often struggle with generalization to the long tail of unexpected situations without heavy human supervision. To address this issue, we investigate how to leverage the broad knowledge about the structure of the world and commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to aid legged robots in handling difficult, ambiguous situations. We propose a system, VLM-Predictive Control (VLM-PC), combining two key components that we find to be crucial for eliciting on-the-fly, adaptive behavior selection with VLMs: (1) in-context adaptation over previous robot interactions and (2) planning multiple skills into the future and replanning. We evaluate VLM-PC on several challenging real-world obstacle courses, involving dead ends and climbing and crawling, on a Go1 quadruped robot. Our experiments show that by reasoning over the history of interactions and future plans, VLMs enable the robot to autonomously perceive, navigate, and act in a wide range of complex scenarios that would otherwise require environment-specific engineering or human guidance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02666v1
Strategic Demand-Planning in Wireless Networks: Can Generative-AI Save Spectrum and Energy?,"Berk Çiloğlu, Görkem Berkay Koç, Afsoon Alidadi Shamsabadi, Metin Ozturk, Halim Yanikomeroglu",2024-07-02,"Wireless communications advance hand-in-hand with artificial intelligence (AI), indicating an interconnected advancement where each facilitates and benefits from the other. This synergy is particularly evident in the development of the sixth-generation technology standard for mobile networks (6G), envisioned to be AI-native. Generative-AI (GenAI), a novel technology capable of producing various types of outputs, including text, images, and videos, offers significant potential for wireless communications, with its distinctive features. Traditionally, conventional AI techniques have been employed for predictions, classifications, and optimization, while GenAI has more to offer. This article introduces the concept of strategic demand-planning through demand-labeling, demand-shaping, and demand-rescheduling. Accordingly, GenAI is proposed as a powerful tool to facilitate demand-shaping in wireless networks. More specifically, GenAI is used to compress and convert the content of various kind (e.g., from a higher bandwidth mode to a lower one, such as from a video to text), which subsequently enhances performance of wireless networks in various usage scenarios such as cell-switching, user association and load balancing, interference management, and disaster scenarios management. Therefore, GenAI can serve a function in saving energy and spectrum in wireless networks. With recent advancements in AI, including sophisticated algorithms like large-language-models and the development of more powerful hardware built exclusively for AI tasks, such as AI accelerators, the concept of demand-planning, particularly demand-shaping through GenAI, becomes increasingly relevant. Furthermore, recent efforts to make GenAI accessible on devices, such as user terminals, make the implementation of this concept even more straightforward and feasible.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02292v1

We propose an LLM-embodied path planning framework for mobile agents, focusing on solving high-level coverage path planning issues and low-level control. Our proposed multi-layer architecture uses prompted LLMs in the path planning phase and integrates them with the mobile agents' low-level actuators. To evaluate the performance of various LLMs, we propose a coverage-weighted path planning metric to assess the performance of the embodied models. Our experiments show that the proposed framework improves LLMs' spatial inference abilities. We demonstrate that the proposed multi-layer framework significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of these tasks by leveraging the natural language understanding and generative capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments show that this framework can improve LLMs' 2D plane reasoning abilities and complete coverage path planning tasks. We also tested three LLM kernels: gpt-4o, gemini-1.5-flash, and claude-3.5-sonnet. The experimental results show that claude-3.5 can complete the coverage planning task in different scenarios, and its indicators are better than those of the other models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02220v2
GRASP: A Grid-Based Benchmark for Evaluating Commonsense Spatial Reasoning,"Zhisheng Tang, Mayank Kejriwal",2024-07-02,"Spatial reasoning, an important faculty of human cognition with many practical applications, is one of the core commonsense skills that is not purely language-based and, for satisfying (as opposed to optimal) solutions, requires some minimum degree of planning. Existing benchmarks of Commonsense Spatial Reasoning (CSR) tend to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret text-based spatial descriptions rather than directly evaluate a plan produced by the LLM in response to a spatial reasoning scenario. In this paper, we construct a large-scale benchmark called $\textbf{GRASP}$, which consists of 16,000 grid-based environments where the agent is tasked with an energy collection problem. These environments include 100 grid instances instantiated using each of the 160 different grid settings, involving five different energy distributions, two modes of agent starting position, and two distinct obstacle configurations, as well as three kinds of agent constraints. Using GRASP, we compare classic baseline approaches, such as random walk and greedy search methods, with advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o. The experimental results indicate that even these advanced LLMs struggle to consistently achieve satisfactory solutions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01892v1
Agentless: Demystifying LLM-based Software Engineering Agents,"Chunqiu Steven Xia, Yinlin Deng, Soren Dunn, Lingming Zhang",2024-07-01,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the automation of software development tasks, including code synthesis, program repair, and test generation. More recently, researchers and industry practitioners have developed various autonomous LLM agents to perform end-to-end software development tasks. These agents are equipped with the ability to use tools, run commands, observe feedback from the environment, and plan for future actions. However, the complexity of these agent-based approaches, together with the limited abilities of current LLMs, raises the following question: Do we really have to employ complex autonomous software agents? To attempt to answer this question, we build Agentless -- an agentless approach to automatically solve software development problems. Compared to the verbose and complex setup of agent-based approaches, Agentless employs a simplistic two-phase process of localization followed by repair, without letting the LLM decide future actions or operate with complex tools. Our results on the popular SWE-bench Lite benchmark show that surprisingly the simplistic Agentless is able to achieve both the highest performance (27.33%) and lowest cost (\$0.34) compared with all existing open-source software agents! Furthermore, we manually classified the problems in SWE-bench Lite and found problems with exact ground truth patch or insufficient/misleading issue descriptions. As such, we construct SWE-bench Lite-S by excluding such problematic issues to perform more rigorous evaluation and comparison. Our work highlights the current overlooked potential of a simple, interpretable technique in autonomous software development. We hope Agentless will help reset the baseline, starting point, and horizon for autonomous software agents, and inspire future work along this crucial direction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01489v1
Tree Search for Language Model Agents,"Jing Yu Koh, Stephen McAleer, Daniel Fried, Ruslan Salakhutdinov",2024-07-01,"Autonomous agents powered by language models (LMs) have demonstrated promise in their ability to perform decision-making tasks such as web automation.

Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%.

However, there is a scarcity of benchmarks available for LLM-based mobile agents. Benchmarking these agents generally faces three main challenges: (1) The inefficiency of UI-only operations imposes limitations to task evaluation. (2) Specific instructions within a singular application lack adequacy for assessing the multi-dimensional reasoning and decision-making capacities of LLM mobile agents. (3) Current evaluation metrics are insufficient to accurately assess the process of sequential actions. To this end, we propose Mobile-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLM-based mobile agents. First, we expand conventional UI operations by incorporating 103 collected APIs to accelerate the efficiency of task completion. Subsequently, we collect evaluation data by combining real user queries with augmentation from LLMs. To better evaluate different levels of planning capabilities for mobile agents, our data is categorized into three distinct groups: SAST, SAMT, and MAMT, reflecting varying levels of task complexity. Mobile-Bench comprises 832 data entries, with more than 200 tasks specifically designed to evaluate multi-APP collaboration scenarios.

BMW Agents -- A Framework For Task Automation Through Multi-Agent Collaboration,"Noel Crawford, Edward B. Duffy, Iman Evazzade, Torsten Foehr, Gregory Robbins, Debbrata Kumar Saha, Jiya Varma, Marcin Ziolkowski",2024-06-28,"Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enormous potential for automation. Early proof of this technology can be found in various demonstrations of agents solving complex tasks, interacting with external systems to augment their knowledge, and triggering actions. In particular, workflows involving multiple agents solving complex tasks in a collaborative fashion exemplify their capacity to operate in less strict and less well-defined environments. Thus, a multi-agent approach has great potential for serving as a backbone in many industrial applications, ranging from complex knowledge retrieval systems to next generation robotic process automation. Given the reasoning abilities within the current generation of LLMs, complex processes require a multi-step approach that includes a plan of well-defined and modular tasks.

Due to the lack of benchmarks, the community still needs to fully understand the hallucination issues within these models. To address this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive diagnostic benchmark, ToolBH. Specifically, we assess the LLM's hallucinations through two perspectives: depth and breadth. In terms of depth, we propose a multi-level diagnostic process, including (1) solvability detection, (2) solution planning, and (3) missing-tool analysis. For breadth, we consider three scenarios based on the characteristics of the toolset: missing necessary tools, potential tools, and limited functionality tools. Furthermore, we developed seven tasks and collected 700 evaluation samples through multiple rounds of manual annotation. The results show the significant challenges presented by the ToolBH benchmark. The current advanced models Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o only achieve a total score of 45.3 and 37.0, respectively, on a scale of 100. In this benchmark, larger model parameters do not guarantee better performance; the training data and response strategies also play a crucial role in tool-enhanced LLM scenarios.

It entails incorporating high-level beliefs from various perspectives on the topic, along with deliberate reasoning and planning to construct a coherent narrative. Current language models often generate surface tokens autoregressively, lacking explicit integration of these underlying controls, resulting in limited output diversity and coherence. In this work, we propose a persona-based multi-agent framework for argument writing. Inspired by the human debate, we first assign each agent a persona representing its high-level beliefs from a unique perspective, and then design an agent interaction process so that the agents can collaboratively debate and discuss the idea to form an overall plan for argument writing. Such debate process enables fluid and nonlinear development of ideas. We evaluate our framework on argumentative essay writing.

Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly, OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data. First, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized tokens for behavior trajectories $\tau$ = {$o_0$, $a_0$, $\dots$} and an imitation learning (IL) policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior tokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language Models (MLMs). With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions involving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual responses, behavior trajectories, etc. into unified token sequences and model them with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful behavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing chain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior tokens for the IL policy decoder).

GenoTEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-Based Exploration of Gene Expression Data in Alignment with Bioinformaticians,"Haoyang Liu, Haohan Wang",2024-06-21,"Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets. However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automatic exploration of gene expression data, involving the tasks of dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis. GenoTEX provides annotated code and results for solving a wide range of gene identification problems, in a full analysis pipeline that follows the standard of computational genomics. These annotations are curated by human bioinformaticians who carefully analyze the datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgents, a team of LLM-based agents designed with context-aware planning, iterative correction, and domain expert consultation to collaboratively explore gene datasets. Our experiments with GenoAgents demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches in genomics data analysis, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing AI-driven methods for genomics data analysis.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression,"Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang",2024-06-21,"Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\%-36\%$ to within $5\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14909v1

ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights,"Gabriel Sarch, Lawrence Jang, Michael J. Tarr, William W. Cohen, Kenneth Marino, Katerina Fragkiadaki",2024-06-20,"Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements.

Augmenting Query and Passage for Retrieval-Augmented Generation using LLMs for Open-Domain Question Answering,"Minsang Kim, Cheoneum Park, Seungjun Baek",2024-06-20,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has received much attention for Open-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks as a means to compensate for the parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). While previous approaches focused on processing retrieved passages to remove irrelevant context, they still rely heavily on the quality of retrieved passages which can degrade if the question is ambiguous or complex. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient method called question and passage augmentation via LLMs for open-domain QA. Our method first decomposes the original questions into multiple-step sub-questions. By augmenting the original question with detailed sub-questions and planning, we are able to make the query more specific on what needs to be retrieved, improving the retrieval performance. In addition, to compensate for the case where the retrieved passages contain distracting information or divided opinions, we augment the retrieved passages with self-generated passages by LLMs to guide the answer extraction.

In addition, RoboPoint is a general model that enables several downstream applications such as robot navigation, manipulation, and augmented reality (AR) assistance. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboPoint outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o) and visual prompting techniques (PIVOT) by 21.8% in the accuracy of predicting spatial affordance and by 30.5% in the success rate of downstream tasks.

MINT: a Multi-modal Image and Narrative Text Dubbing Dataset for Foley Audio Content Planning and Generation,"Ruibo Fu, Shuchen Shi, Hongming Guo, Tao Wang, Chunyu Qiang, Zhengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao, Xin Qi, Yi Lu, Xiaopeng Wang, Zhiyong Wang, Yukun Liu, Xuefei Liu, Shuai Zhang, Guanjun Li",2024-06-15,"Foley audio, critical for enhancing the immersive experience in multimedia content, faces significant challenges in the AI-generated content (AIGC) landscape. Despite advancements in AIGC technologies for text and image generation, the foley audio dubbing remains rudimentary due to difficulties in cross-modal scene matching and content correlation. Current text-to-audio technology, which relies on detailed and acoustically relevant textual descriptions, falls short in practical video dubbing applications. Existing datasets like AudioSet, AudioCaps, Clotho, Sound-of-Story, and WavCaps do not fully meet the requirements for real-world foley audio dubbing task. To address this, we introduce the Multi-modal Image and Narrative Text Dubbing Dataset (MINT), designed to enhance mainstream dubbing tasks such as literary story audiobooks dubbing, image/silent video dubbing. Besides, to address the limitations of existing TTA technology in understanding and planning complex prompts, a Foley Audio Content Planning, Generation, and Alignment (CPGA) framework is proposed, which includes a content planning module leveraging large language models for complex multi-modal prompts comprehension. Additionally, the training process is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization based reinforcement learning, significantly improving the alignment and auditory realism of generated foley audio. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly advances the field of foley audio dubbing, providing robust solutions for the challenges of multi-modal dubbing. Even when utilizing the relatively lightweight GPT-2 model, our framework outperforms open-source multimodal large models such as LLaVA, DeepSeek-VL, and Moondream2.

Unlocking Large Language Model's Planning Capabilities with Maximum Diversity Fine-tuning,"Wenjun Li, Changyu Chen, Pradeep Varakantham",2024-06-15,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive task-solving capabilities, achieved through either prompting techniques or system designs. However, concerns have arisen regarding their proficiency in planning tasks, as they often struggle to generate valid plans. This paper investigates the impact of fine-tuning on LLMs' planning capabilities. Our findings indicate that LLMs can achieve good performance in planning through substantial (thousands of specific examples) fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning is associated with significant economic and computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose the Maximum Diversity Fine-Tuning (MDFT) strategy to improve the sample efficiency of fine-tuning in the planning domain. Specifically, our algorithm, referred to as MDFT-g, encodes the planning task instances with their graph representations and selects a subset of samples in the vector space that maximizes data diversity. We empirically demonstrate that MDFT-g consistently outperforms existing baselines at various scales across multiple benchmark domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10479v1
TRIP-PAL: Travel Planning with Guarantees by Combining Large Language Models and Automated Planners,"Tomas de la Rosa, Sriram Gopalakrishnan, Alberto Pozanco, Zhen Zeng, Daniel Borrajo",2024-06-14,"Travel planning is a complex task that involves generating a sequence of actions related to visiting places subject to constraints and maximizing some user satisfaction criteria. Traditional approaches rely on problem formulation in a given formal language, extracting relevant travel information from web sources, and use an adequate problem solver to generate a valid solution. As an alternative, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based approaches directly output plans from user requests using language. Although LLMs possess extensive travel domain knowledge and provide high-level information like points of interest and potential routes, current state-of-the-art models often generate plans that lack coherence, fail to satisfy constraints fully, and do not guarantee the generation of high-quality solutions. We propose TRIP-PAL, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of LLMs and automated planners, where (i) LLMs get and translate travel information and user information into data structures that can be fed into planners; and (ii) automated planners generate travel plans that guarantee constraint satisfaction and optimize for users' utility. Our experiments across various travel scenarios show that TRIP-PAL outperforms an LLM when generating travel plans.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10196v1
Details Make a Difference: Object State-Sensitive Neurorobotic Task Planning,"Xiaowen Sun, Xufeng Zhao, Jae Hee Lee, Wenhao Lu, Matthias Kerzel, Stefan Wermter",2024-06-14,"The state of an object reflects its current status or condition and is important for a robot's task planning and manipulation. However, detecting an object's state and generating a state-sensitive plan for robots is challenging. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or VLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we introduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent empowered by pre-trained neural networks. We propose two methods for OSSA: (i) a modular model consisting of a pre-trained vision processing module (dense captioning model, DCM) and a natural language processing model (LLM), and (ii) a monolithic model consisting only of a VLM. To quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to clear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object states into consideration. Our results show that both methods can be used for object state-sensitive tasks, but the monolithic approach outperforms the modular approach.

DAG-Plan: Generating Directed Acyclic Dependency Graphs for Dual-Arm Cooperative Planning,"Zeyu Gao, Yao Mu, Jinye Qu, Mengkang Hu, Lingyue Guo, Ping Luo, Yanfeng Lu",2024-06-14,"Dual-arm robots offer enhanced versatility and efficiency over single-arm counterparts by enabling concurrent manipulation of multiple objects or cooperative execution of tasks using both arms. However, effectively coordinating the two arms for complex long-horizon tasks remains a significant challenge. Existing task planning methods predominantly focus on single-arm robots or rely on predefined bimanual operations, failing to fully leverage the capabilities of dual-arm systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DAG-Plan, a structured task planning framework tailored for dual-arm robots. DAG-Plan harnesses large language models (LLMs) to decompose intricate tasks into actionable sub-tasks represented as nodes within a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Critically, DAG-Plan dynamically assigns these sub-tasks to the appropriate arm based on real-time environmental observations, enabling parallel and adaptive execution. We evaluate DAG-Plan on the novel Dual-Arm Kitchen Benchmark, comprising 9 sequential tasks with 78 sub-tasks and 26 objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DAG-Plan over directly using LLM to generate plans, achieving nearly 50% higher efficiency compared to the single-arm task planning baseline and nearly double the success rate of the dual-arm task planning baseline.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09953v2

Optimized Feature Generation for Tabular Data via LLMs with Decision Tree Reasoning,"Jaehyun Nam, Kyuyoung Kim, Seunghyuk Oh, Jihoon Tack, Jaehyung Kim, Jinwoo Shin",2024-06-12,"Learning effective representations from raw data is crucial for the success of deep learning methods. However, in the tabular domain, practitioners often prefer augmenting raw column features over using learned representations, as conventional tree-based algorithms frequently outperform competing approaches. As a result, feature engineering methods that automatically generate candidate features have been widely used. While these approaches are often effective, there remains ambiguity in defining the space over which to search for candidate features. Moreover, they often rely solely on validation scores to select good features, neglecting valuable feedback from past experiments that could inform the planning of future experiments. To address the shortcomings, we propose a new tabular learning framework based on large language models (LLMs), coined Optimizing Column feature generator with decision Tree reasoning (OCTree). Our key idea is to leverage LLMs' reasoning capabilities to find good feature generation rules without manually specifying the search space and provide language-based reasoning information highlighting past experiments as feedback for iterative rule improvements. Here, we choose a decision tree as reasoning as it can be interpreted in natural language, effectively conveying knowledge of past experiments (i.e., the prediction models trained with the generated features) to the LLM. Our empirical results demonstrate that this simple framework consistently enhances the performance of various prediction models across diverse tabular benchmarks, outperforming competing automatic feature engineering methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08527v1

As a result, developing principled and automated optimization methods for compound AI systems is one of the most important new challenges. Neural networks faced a similar challenge in its early days until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turn-key. Inspired by this, we introduce TextGrad, a powerful framework performing automatic ``differentiation'' via text. TextGrad backpropagates textual feedback provided by LLMs to improve individual components of a compound AI system. In our framework, LLMs provide rich, general, natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation graphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular structures. TextGrad follows PyTorch's syntax and abstraction and is flexible and easy-to-use. It works out-of-the-box for a variety of tasks, where the users only provide the objective function without tuning components or prompts of the framework. We showcase TextGrad's effectiveness and generality across a diverse range of applications, from question answering and molecule optimization to radiotherapy treatment planning. Without modifying the framework, TextGrad improves the zero-shot accuracy of GPT-4o in Google-Proof Question Answering from $51\%$ to $55\%$, yields $20\%$ relative performance gain in optimizing LeetCode-Hard coding problem solutions, improves prompts for reasoning, designs new druglike small molecules with desirable in silico binding, and designs radiation oncology treatment plans with high specificity.

CADS: A Systematic Literature Review on the Challenges of Abstractive Dialogue Summarization,"Frederic Kirstein, Jan Philip Wahle, Bela Gipp, Terry Ruas",2024-06-11,"Abstractive dialogue summarization is the task of distilling conversations into informative and concise summaries. Although reviews have been conducted on this topic, there is a lack of comprehensive work detailing the challenges of dialogue summarization, unifying the differing understanding of the task, and aligning proposed techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics with the challenges. This article summarizes the research on Transformer-based abstractive summarization for English dialogues by systematically reviewing 1262 unique research papers published between 2019 and 2024, relying on the Semantic Scholar and DBLP databases. We cover the main challenges present in dialog summarization (i.e., language, structure, comprehension, speaker, salience, and factuality) and link them to corresponding techniques such as graph-based approaches, additional training tasks, and planning strategies, which typically overly rely on BART-based encoder-decoder models. We find that while some challenges, like language, have seen considerable progress, mainly due to training methods, others, such as comprehension, factuality, and salience, remain difficult and hold significant research opportunities. We investigate how these approaches are typically assessed, covering the datasets for the subdomains of dialogue (e.g., meeting, medical), the established automatic metrics and human evaluation approaches for assessing scores and annotator agreement. We observe that only a few datasets span across all subdomains. The ROUGE metric is the most used, while human evaluation is frequently reported without sufficient detail on inner-annotator agreement and annotation guidelines. Additionally, we discuss the possible implications of the recently explored large language models and conclude that despite a potential shift in relevance and difficulty, our described challenge taxonomy remains relevant.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07494v2
PITCH: Productivity and Mental Well-being Coaching through Daily Conversational Interaction,"Adnan Abbas, Sang Won Lee",2024-06-11,"Efficient task planning is essential for productivity and mental well-being, yet individuals often struggle to create realistic plans and reflect upon their productivity. Leveraging the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), conversational agents have emerged as a promising tool for enhancing productivity. Our work focuses on externalizing plans through conversation, aiming to solidify intentions and foster focused action, thereby positively impacting their productivity and mental well-being. We share our plan of designing a conversational agent to offer insightful questions and reflective prompts for increasing plan adherence by leveraging the social interactivity of natural conversations. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of such agents, but many interventions remain static, leading to decreased user engagement over time. To address this limitation, we propose a novel rotation and context-aware prompting strategy, providing users with varied interventions daily. Our system, PITCH, utilizes large language models (LLMs) to facilitate externalization and reflection on daily plans. Through this study, we investigate the impact of externalizing tasks with conversational agents on productivity and mental well-being, and the effectiveness of a rotation strategy in maintaining user engagement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07485v1
Advancing Tool-Augmented Large Language Models: Integrating Insights from Errors in Inference Trees,"Sijia Chen, Yibo Wang, Yi-Feng Wu, Qing-Guo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, Lijun Zhang",2024-06-11,"Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage tools, often in the form of APIs, to enhance their reasoning capabilities on complex tasks, thus taking on the role of intelligent agents interacting with the real world. The recently introduced ToolLLaMA model by Qin et al. [2024] utilizes the depth-first search-based decision tree (DFSDT) method for reasoning with $16000+$ real-world APIs, which effectively improves the planning and inferencing performance of tool-augmented LLMs compared to traditional chain reasoning approaches. However, their approach only employs successful paths from decision trees (also called inference trees) for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) during training, which does not fully exploit the advantages of the tree of thought. In this study, we propose an inference trajectory optimization framework based on the preference data extracted from decision trees to address this limitation. We first introduce a novel method for constructing preference data from the tree of thought, capitalizing on the failed explorations previously overlooked in the trees. Specifically, we generate an effective step-wise preference dataset, named ToolPreference, for tool use based on the ToolBench dataset. In the subsequent training phase, we first fine-tune the LLM with tool-usage expert trajectories and then use these step-wise preference pairs for direct preference optimization (DPO) to update the policy of the LLM, resulting in our ToolPrefer-LLaMA (TP-LLaMA) model. Our experiments demonstrate that by obtaining insights from errors in inference trees, TP-LLaMA significantly outperforms the baselines across almost all test scenarios by a large margin and exhibits better generalization capabilities with unseen APIs. At the same time, TP-LLaMA has also demonstrated superior reasoning efficiency compared to the baselines, making it more suitable for complex tool-usage reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07115v1
Entropy-Reinforced Planning with Large Language Models for Drug Discovery,"Xuefeng Liu, Chih-chan Tien, Peng Ding, Songhao Jiang, Rick L. Stevens",2024-06-11,"The objective of drug discovery is to identify chemical compounds that possess specific pharmaceutical properties toward a binding target. Existing large language models (LLMS) can achieve high token matching scores in terms of likelihood for molecule generation. However, relying solely on LLM decoding often results in the generation of molecules that are either invalid due to a single misused token, or suboptimal due to unbalanced exploration and exploitation as a consequence of the LLMs prior experience. Here we propose ERP, Entropy-Reinforced Planning for Transformer Decoding, which employs an entropy-reinforced planning algorithm to enhance the Transformer decoding process and strike a balance between exploitation and exploration. ERP aims to achieve improvements in multiple properties compared to direct sampling from the Transformer. We evaluated ERP on the SARS-CoV-2 virus (3CLPro) and human cancer cell target protein (RTCB) benchmarks and demonstrated that, in both benchmarks, ERP consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm by 1-5 percent, and baselines by 5-10 percent, respectively.

In this paper, we examine the topic of LLM planning for a set of continuously parameterized skills whose execution must avoid violations of a set of kinematic, geometric, and physical constraints. We prompt the LLM to output code for a function with open parameters, which, together with environmental constraints, can be viewed as a Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CCSP). This CCSP can be solved through sampling or optimization to find a skill sequence and continuous parameter settings that achieve the goal while avoiding constraint violations. Additionally, we consider cases where the LLM proposes unsatisfiable CCSPs, such as those that are kinematically infeasible, dynamically unstable, or lead to collisions, and re-prompt the LLM to form a new CCSP accordingly. Experiments across three different simulated 3D domains demonstrate that our proposed strategy, PRoC3S, is capable of solving a wide range of complex manipulation tasks with realistic constraints on continuous parameters much more efficiently and effectively than existing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05572v1
Towards a Benchmark for Causal Business Process Reasoning with LLMs,"Fabiana Fournier, Lior Limonad, Inna Skarbovsky",2024-06-08,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for boosting organizational efficiency and automating tasks. While not originally designed for complex cognitive processes, recent efforts have further extended to employ LLMs in activities such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making. In business processes, such abilities could be invaluable for leveraging on the massive corpora LLMs have been trained on for gaining deep understanding of such processes. In this work, we plant the seeds for the development of a benchmark to assess the ability of LLMs to reason about causal and process perspectives of business operations. We refer to this view as Causally-augmented Business Processes (BP^C). The core of the benchmark comprises a set of BP^C related situations, a set of questions about these situations, and a set of deductive rules employed to systematically resolve the ground truth answers to these questions. Also with the power of LLMs, the seed is then instantiated into a larger-scale set of domain-specific situations and questions. Reasoning on BP^C is of crucial importance for process interventions and process improvement.

The Factorization Curse: Which Tokens You Predict Underlie the Reversal Curse and More,"Ouail Kitouni, Niklas Nolte, Diane Bouchacourt, Adina Williams, Mike Rabbat, Mark Ibrahim",2024-06-07,"Today's best language models still struggle with hallucinations: factually incorrect generations, which impede their ability to reliably retrieve information seen during training. The reversal curse, where models cannot recall information when probed in a different order than was encountered during training, exemplifies this in information retrieval. We reframe the reversal curse as a factorization curse - a failure of models to learn the same joint distribution under different factorizations. Through a series of controlled experiments with increasing levels of realism including WikiReversal, a setting we introduce to closely simulate a knowledge intensive finetuning task, we find that the factorization curse is an inherent failure of the next-token prediction objective used in popular large language models. Moreover, we demonstrate reliable information retrieval cannot be solved with scale, reversed tokens, or even naive bidirectional-attention training. Consequently, various approaches to finetuning on specialized data would necessarily provide mixed results on downstream tasks, unless the model has already seen the right sequence of tokens. Across five tasks of varying levels of complexity, our results uncover a promising path forward: factorization-agnostic objectives can significantly mitigate the reversal curse and hint at improved knowledge storage and planning capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05183v1

Unfortunately, we have found that the efficiency of current parallel training is often suboptimal, largely due to the following two main issues. Firstly, hardware failures are inevitable, leading to interruptions in the training tasks. The inability to quickly identify the faulty components results in a substantial waste of GPU resources. Secondly, since GPUs must wait for parameter synchronization to complete before proceeding to the next round of computation, network congestions can greatly increase the waiting time for GPUs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a communication-driven solution, namely the C4. The key insights of C4 are two folds. First, in parallel training, collective communication exhibits periodic and homogeneous characteristics, so any anomalies are certainly due to some form of hardware malfunction. By leveraging this feature, C4 can rapidly identify the faulty components, swiftly isolate the anomaly, and restart the task, thereby avoiding resource wastage caused by delays in anomaly detection. Second, the predictable communication model of collective communication, involving few large flows, allows C4 to efficiently execute traffic planning, substantially reducing network congestion. C4 has been extensively implemented across our production systems, cutting error-induced overhead by roughly 30% and enhancing runtime performance by about 15% for certain applications with moderate communication costs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04594v1

Language can be used by human to task a robot, by a robot to inform a human, between robots as a human-like communication medium, and internally for a robot's planning and control.

Tool-Planner: Dynamic Solution Tree Planning for Large Language Model with Tool Clustering,"Yanming Liu, Xinyue Peng, Yuwei Zhang, Jiannan Cao, Xuhong Zhang, Sheng Cheng, Xun Wang, Jianwei Yin, Tianyu Du",2024-06-06,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, enabling them to solve various complex problems. Recently, this ability has been applied to the paradigm of tool learning. Tool learning involves providing examples of tool usage and their corresponding functions, allowing LLMs to formulate plans and demonstrate the process of invoking and executing each tool. LLMs can address tasks that they cannot complete independently, thereby enhancing their potential across different tasks. However, this approach faces two key challenges. First, redundant error correction leads to unstable planning and long execution time. Additionally, designing a correct plan among multiple tools is also a challenge in tool learning. To address these issues, we propose Tool-Planner, a task-processing framework based on toolkits. Tool-Planner groups tools based on the API functions with the same function into a toolkit and allows LLMs to implement planning across the various toolkits. When a tool error occurs, the language model can reselect and adjust tools based on the toolkit. Experiments show that our approach demonstrates a high pass and win rate across different datasets and optimizes the planning scheme for tool learning in models such as GPT-4 and Claude 3, showcasing the potential of our method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03807v1
CLMASP: Coupling Large Language Models with Answer Set Programming for Robotic Task Planning,"Xinrui Lin, Yangfan Wu, Huanyu Yang, Yu Zhang, Yanyong Zhang, Jianmin Ji",2024-06-05,"Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive foundational knowledge and moderate reasoning abilities, making them suitable for general task planning in open-world scenarios. However, it is challenging to ground a LLM-generated plan to be executable for the specified robot with certain restrictions. This paper introduces CLMASP, an approach that couples LLMs with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome the limitations, where ASP is a non-monotonic logic programming formalism renowned for its capacity to represent and reason about a robot's action knowledge. CLMASP initiates with a LLM generating a basic skeleton plan, which is subsequently tailored to the specific scenario using a vector database. This plan is then refined by an ASP program with a robot's action knowledge, which integrates implementation details into the skeleton, grounding the LLM's abstract outputs in practical robot contexts. Our experiments conducted on the VirtualHome platform demonstrate CLMASP's efficacy. Compared to the baseline executable rate of under 2% with LLM approaches, CLMASP significantly improves this to over 90%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03367v1
Language Models can Infer Action Semantics for Classical Planners from Environment Feedback,"Wang Zhu, Ishika Singh, Robin Jia, Jesse Thomason",2024-06-04,"Classical planning approaches guarantee finding a set of actions that can achieve a given goal state when possible, but require an expert to specify logical action semantics that govern the dynamics of the environment. Researchers have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to directly infer planning steps based on commonsense knowledge and minimal domain information alone, but such plans often fail on execution. We bring together the strengths of classical planning and LLM commonsense inference to perform domain induction, learning and validating action pre- and post-conditions based on closed-loop interactions with the environment itself. We propose PSALM, which leverages LLM inference to heuristically complete partial plans emitted by a classical planner given partial domain knowledge, as well as to infer the semantic rules of the domain in a logical language based on environment feedback after execution. Our analysis on 7 environments shows that with just one expert-curated example plans, using LLMs as heuristic planners and rule predictors achieves lower environment execution steps and environment resets than random exploration while simultaneously recovering the underlying ground truth action semantics of the domain.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02791v1
Efficient Behavior Tree Planning with Commonsense Pruning and Heuristic,"Xinglin Chen, Yishuai Cai, Yunxin Mao, Minglong Li, Zhou Yang, Wen Shanghua, Wenjing Yang, Weixia Xu, Ji Wang",2024-06-03,"Behavior Tree (BT) planning is crucial for autonomous robot behavior control, yet its application in complex scenarios is hampered by long planning times. Pruning and heuristics are common techniques to accelerate planning, but it is difficult to design general pruning strategies and heuristic functions for BT planning problems. This paper proposes improving BT planning efficiency for everyday service robots leveraging commonsense reasoning provided by Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to model-free pre-planning action space pruning and heuristic generation. This approach takes advantage of the modularity and interpretability of BT nodes, represented by predicate logic, to enable LLMs to predict the task-relevant action predicates and objects, and even the optimal path, without an explicit action model. We propose the Heuristic Optimal Behavior Tree Expansion Algorithm (HOBTEA) with two heuristic variants and provide a formal comparison and discussion of their efficiency and optimality. We introduce a learnable and transferable commonsense library to enhance the LLM's reasoning performance without fine-tuning. The action space expansion based on the commonsense library can further increase the success rate of planning. Experiments show the theoretical bounds of commonsense pruning and heuristic, and demonstrate the actual performance of LLM learning and reasoning with the commonsense library. Results in four datasets showcase the practical effectiveness of our approach in everyday service robot applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00965v2
Towards a copilot in BIM authoring tool using a large language model-based agent for intelligent human-machine interaction,"Changyu Du, Stavros Nousias, André Borrmann",2024-06-02,"Facing increasingly complex BIM authoring software and the accompanying expensive learning costs, designers often seek to interact with the software in a more intelligent and lightweight manner. They aim to automate modeling workflows, avoiding obstacles and difficulties caused by software usage, thereby focusing on the design process itself. To address this issue, we proposed an LLM-based autonomous agent framework that can function as a copilot in the BIM authoring tool, answering software usage questions, understanding the user's design intentions from natural language, and autonomously executing modeling tasks by invoking the appropriate tools. In a case study based on the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, we implemented a software prototype to integrate the proposed framework seamlessly into the BIM authoring scenario.

Guiding and Diversifying LLM-Based Story Generation via Answer Set Programming,"Phoebe J. Wang, Max Kreminski",2024-06-01,"Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating stories in response to open-ended user requests, but the resulting stories tend to be limited in their diversity. Older, symbolic approaches to story generation (such as planning) can generate substantially more diverse plot outlines, but are limited to producing stories that recombine a fixed set of hand-engineered character action templates. Can we combine the strengths of these approaches while mitigating their weaknesses? We propose to do so by using a higher-level and more abstract symbolic specification of high-level story structure -- implemented via answer set programming (ASP) -- to guide and diversify LLM-based story generation. Via semantic similarity analysis, we demonstrate that our approach produces more diverse stories than an unguided LLM, and via code excerpts, we demonstrate the improved compactness and flexibility of ASP-based outline generation over full-fledged narrative planning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00554v2
Evaluating Uncertainty-based Failure Detection for Closed-Loop LLM Planners,"Zhi Zheng, Qian Feng, Hang Li, Alois Knoll, Jianxiang Feng",2024-06-01,"Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable performance as zero-shot task planners for robotic manipulation tasks. However, the open-loop nature of previous works makes LLM-based planning error-prone and fragile. On the other hand, failure detection approaches for closed-loop planning are often limited by task-specific heuristics or following an unrealistic assumption that the prediction is trustworthy all the time. As a general-purpose reasoning machine, LLMs or Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are promising for detecting failures. However, However, the appropriateness of the aforementioned assumption diminishes due to the notorious hullucination problem. In this work, we attempt to mitigate these issues by introducing a framework for closed-loop LLM-based planning called KnowLoop, backed by an uncertainty-based MLLMs failure detector, which is agnostic to any used MLLMs or LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate three different ways for quantifying the uncertainty of MLLMs, namely token probability, entropy, and self-explained confidence as primary metrics based on three carefully designed representative prompting strategies. With a self-collected dataset including various manipulation tasks and an LLM-based robot system, our experiments demonstrate that token probability and entropy are more reflective compared to self-explained confidence. By setting an appropriate threshold to filter out uncertain predictions and seek human help actively, the accuracy of failure detection can be significantly enhanced. This improvement boosts the effectiveness of closed-loop planning and the overall success rate of tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00430v1
Robust Planning with LLM-Modulo Framework: Case Study in Travel Planning,"Atharva Gundawar, Mudit Verma, Lin Guan, Karthik Valmeekam, Siddhant Bhambri, Subbarao Kambhampati",2024-05-31,"As the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) extends beyond traditional text processing tasks, there is a burgeoning interest in their potential to excel in planning and reasoning assignments, realms traditionally reserved for System 2 cognitive competencies.

The recent discourse introduced by the paper on LLM Modulo marks a significant stride, proposing a conceptual framework that enhances the integration of LLMs into diverse planning and reasoning activities. This workshop paper delves into the practical application of this framework within the domain of travel planning, presenting a specific instance of its implementation. We are using the Travel Planning benchmark by the OSU NLP group, a benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLMs in producing valid itineraries based on user queries presented in natural language. While popular methods of enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs such as Chain of Thought, ReAct, and Reflexion achieve a meager 0%, 0.6%, and 0% with GPT3.5-Turbo respectively, our operationalization of the LLM-Modulo framework for TravelPlanning domain provides a remarkable improvement, enhancing baseline performances by 4.6x for GPT4-Turbo and even more for older models like GPT3.5-Turbo from 0% to 5%.

From Words to Actions: Unveiling the Theoretical Underpinnings of LLM-Driven Autonomous Systems,"Jianliang He, Siyu Chen, Fengzhuo Zhang, Zhuoran Yang",2024-05-30,"In this work, from a theoretical lens, we aim to understand why large language model (LLM) empowered agents are able to solve decision-making problems in the physical world. To this end, consider a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) model where the LLM Planner and the Actor perform high-level task planning and low-level execution, respectively. Under this model, the LLM Planner navigates a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) by iteratively generating language-based subgoals via prompting. Under proper assumptions on the pretraining data, we prove that the pretrained LLM Planner effectively performs Bayesian aggregated imitation learning (BAIL) through in-context learning. Additionally, we highlight the necessity for exploration beyond the subgoals derived from BAIL by proving that naively executing the subgoals returned by LLM leads to a linear regret. As a remedy, we introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy to BAIL, which is proven to incur sublinear regret when the pretraining error is small. Finally, we extend our theoretical framework to include scenarios where the LLM Planner serves as a world model for inferring the transition model of the environment and to multi-agent settings, enabling coordination among multiple Actors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19883v2
Deciphering Human Mobility: Inferring Semantics of Trajectories with Large Language Models,"Yuxiao Luo, Zhongcai Cao, Xin Jin, Kang Liu, Ling Yin",2024-05-30,"Understanding human mobility patterns is essential for various applications, from urban planning to public safety. The individual trajectory such as mobile phone location data, while rich in spatio-temporal information, often lacks semantic detail, limiting its utility for in-depth mobility analysis. Existing methods can infer basic routine activity sequences from this data, lacking depth in understanding complex human behaviors and users' characteristics. Additionally, they struggle with the dependency on hard-to-obtain auxiliary datasets like travel surveys. To address these limitations, this paper defines trajectory semantic inference through three key dimensions: user occupation category, activity sequence, and trajectory description, and proposes the Trajectory Semantic Inference with Large Language Models (TSI-LLM) framework to leverage LLMs infer trajectory semantics comprehensively and deeply. We adopt spatio-temporal attributes enhanced data formatting (STFormat) and design a context-inclusive prompt, enabling LLMs to more effectively interpret and infer the semantics of trajectory data. Experimental validation on real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficacy of TSI-LLM in deciphering complex human mobility patterns.

The almost human-like performance of LLMs in these areas is indeed very impressive, surprising, and a major breakthrough. Their capabilities are very useful in certain tasks, such as writing first drafts of documents, code writing assistance, text summarization, etc. However, their success is limited in highly scientific domains as they cannot yet reason, plan, or explain due to their lack of in-depth domain knowledge. This is a problem in domains such as chemical engineering as they are governed by fundamental laws of physics and chemistry (and biology), constitutive relations, and highly technical knowledge about materials, processes, and systems. Although purely data-driven machine learning has its immediate uses, the long-term success of AI in scientific and engineering domains would depend on developing hybrid AI systems that use first principles and technical knowledge effectively.

However, LLM agents still struggle with tasks that require comprehensive planning, a process that challenges current models and remains a critical research issue. In this study, we concentrate on travel planning, a Multi-Phases planning problem, that involves multiple interconnected stages, such as outlining, information gathering, and planning, often characterized by the need to manage various constraints and uncertainties. Existing reasoning approaches have struggled to effectively address this complex task. Our research aims to address this challenge by developing a human-like planning framework for LLM agents, i.e., guiding the LLM agent to simulate various steps that humans take when solving Multi-Phases problems. Specifically, we implement several strategies to enable LLM agents to generate a coherent outline for each travel query, mirroring human planning patterns.

Understanding the customer needs is critical part of online business, specifically fashion products. Retailers uses assortment planning to determine the mix of products to offer in each store and channel, stay responsive to market dynamics and to manage inventory and catalogs. The goal is to offer the right styles, in the right sizes and colors, through the right channels. When shoppers find products that meet their needs and desires, they are more likely to return for future purchases, fostering customer loyalty. Product attributes are a key factor in assortment planning. In this paper we present PAE, a product attribute extraction algorithm for future trend reports consisting text and images in PDF format. Most existing methods focus on attribute extraction from titles or product descriptions or utilize visual information from existing product images. Compared to the prior works, our work focuses on attribute extraction from PDF files where upcoming fashion trends are explained. This work proposes a more comprehensive framework that fully utilizes the different modalities for attribute extraction and help retailers to plan the assortment in advance. Our contributions are three-fold: (a) We develop PAE, an efficient framework to extract attributes from unstructured data (text and images); (b) We provide catalog matching methodology based on BERT representations to discover the existing attributes using upcoming attribute values; (c) We conduct extensive experiments with several baselines and show that PAE is an effective, flexible and on par or superior (avg 92.5% F1-Score) framework to existing state-of-the-art for attribute value extraction task.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17533v1
Meta-Task Planning for Language Agents,"Cong Zhang, Derrick Goh Xin Deik, Dexun Li, Hao Zhang, Yong Liu",2024-05-26,"The rapid advancement of neural language models has sparked a new surge of intelligent agent research. Unlike traditional agents, large language model-based agents (LLM agents) have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their superior reasoning and generalization capabilities. Effective planning is crucial for the success of LLM agents in real-world tasks, making it a highly pursued topic in the community. Current planning methods typically translate tasks into executable action sequences. However, determining a feasible or optimal sequence for complex tasks at fine granularity, which often requires compositing long chains of heterogeneous actions, remains challenging. This paper introduces Meta-Task Planning (MTP), a zero-shot methodology for collaborative LLM-based multi-agent systems that simplifies complex task planning by decomposing it into a hierarchy of subordinate tasks, or meta-tasks. Each meta-task is then mapped into executable actions. MTP was assessed on two rigorous benchmarks, TravelPlanner and API-Bank. Notably, MTP achieved an average $\sim40\%$ success rate on TravelPlanner, significantly higher than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline ($2.92\%$), and outperforming $LLM_{api}$-4 with ReAct on API-Bank by $\sim14\%$, showing the immense potential of integrating LLM with multi-agent systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16510v3

However, these agents typically require elaborate design and expert prompts to solve tasks in specific domains, which limits their adaptability. We introduce AutoManual, a framework enabling LLM agents to autonomously build their understanding through interaction and adapt to new environments. AutoManual categorizes environmental knowledge into diverse rules and optimizes them in an online fashion by two agents: 1) The Planner codes actionable plans based on current rules for interacting with the environment. 2) The Builder updates the rules through a well-structured rule system that facilitates online rule management and essential detail retention. To mitigate hallucinations in managing rules, we introduce \textit{case-conditioned prompting} strategy for the Builder. Finally, the Formulator agent compiles these rules into a comprehensive manual.

Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Large Language Model-based Search,"Siddhant Bhambri, Amrita Bhattacharjee, Huan Liu, Subbarao Kambhampati",2024-05-24,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from sample inefficiency in sparse reward domains, and the problem is pronounced if there are stochastic transitions. To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied approach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to an optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function specific to each problem is challenging, even for domain experts. They would either have to rely on task-specific domain knowledge or provide an expert demonstration independently for each task. Given, that Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly gained prominence across a magnitude of natural language tasks, we aim to answer the following question: Can we leverage LLMs to construct a reward shaping function that can boost the sample efficiency of an RL agent? In this work, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to generate a guide policy by solving a simpler deterministic abstraction of the original problem that can then be used to construct the reward shaping function for the downstream RL agent. Given the ineffectiveness of directly prompting LLMs, we propose MEDIC: a framework that augments LLMs with a Model-based feEDback critIC, which verifies LLM-generated outputs, to generate a possibly sub-optimal but valid plan for the abstract problem. Our experiments across domains from the BabyAI environment suite show 1) the effectiveness of augmenting LLMs with MEDIC, 2) a significant improvement in the sample complexity of PPO and A2C-based RL agents when guided by our LLM-generated plan, and finally, 3) pave the direction for further explorations of how these models can be used to augment existing RL pipelines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15194v1
Towards Efficient LLM Grounding for Embodied Multi-Agent Collaboration,"Yang Zhang, Shixin Yang, Chenjia Bai, Fei Wu, Xiu Li, Zhen Wang, Xuelong Li",2024-05-23,"Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://read-llm.github.io/.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14314v2
Agent Planning with World Knowledge Model,"Shuofei Qiao, Runnan Fang, Ningyu Zhang, Yuqi Zhu, Xiang Chen, Shumin Deng, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen",2024-05-23,"Recent endeavors towards directly using large language models (LLMs) as agent models to execute interactive planning tasks have shown commendable results. Despite their achievements, however, they still struggle with brainless trial-and-error in global planning and generating hallucinatory actions in local planning due to their poor understanding of the ''real'' physical world. Imitating humans' mental world knowledge model which provides global prior knowledge before the task and maintains local dynamic knowledge during the task, in this paper, we introduce parametric World Knowledge Model (WKM) to facilitate agent planning. Concretely, we steer the agent model to self-synthesize knowledge from both expert and sampled trajectories. Then we develop WKM, providing prior task knowledge to guide the global planning and dynamic state knowledge to assist the local planning. Experimental results on three complex real-world simulated datasets with three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama-3-8B, demonstrate that our method can achieve superior performance compared to various strong baselines. Besides, we analyze to illustrate that our WKM can effectively alleviate the blind trial-and-error and hallucinatory action issues, providing strong support for the agent's understanding of the world. Other interesting findings include: 1) our instance-level task knowledge can generalize better to unseen tasks, 2) weak WKM can guide strong agent model planning, and 3) unified WKM training has promising potential for further development.

LLM+Reasoning+Planning for supporting incomplete user queries in presence of APIs,"Sudhir Agarwal, Anu Sreepathy, David H. Alonso, Prarit Lamba",2024-05-21,"Recent availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of numerous LLM-based approaches aimed at providing natural language interfaces for various end-user tasks. These end-user tasks in turn can typically be accomplished by orchestrating a given set of APIs. In practice, natural language task requests (user queries) are often incomplete, i.e., they may not contain all the information required by the APIs. While LLMs excel at natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they frequently hallucinate on missing information or struggle with orchestrating the APIs. The key idea behind our proposed approach is to leverage logical reasoning and classical AI planning along with an LLM for accurately answering user queries including identification and gathering of any missing information in these queries. Our approach uses an LLM and ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to translate a user query to a representation in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) via an intermediate representation in ASP. We introduce a special API ""get_info_api"" for gathering missing information. We model all the APIs as PDDL actions in a way that supports dataflow between the APIs. Our approach then uses a classical AI planner to generate an orchestration of API calls (including calls to get_info_api) to answer the user query. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly outperforms a pure LLM based approach by achieving over 95\% success rate in most cases on a dataset containing complete and incomplete single goal and multi-goal queries where the multi-goal queries may or may not require dataflow among the APIs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12433v1
A review on the use of large language models as virtual tutors,"Silvia García-Méndez, Francisco de Arriba-Pérez, María del Carmen Somoza-López",2024-05-20,"Transformer architectures contribute to managing long-term dependencies for Natural Language Processing, representing one of the most recent changes in the field.

Accordingly, these generative Artificial Intelligence-based solutions have directed the change in techniques and the evolution in educational methods and contents, along with network infrastructure, towards high-quality learning. Given the popularity of LLMs, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of those solutions designed specifically to generate and evaluate educational materials and which involve students and teachers in their design or experimental plan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of educational applications (e.g., student assessment) of LLMs. As expected, the most common role of these systems is as virtual tutors for automatic question generation.

Evaluating and Modeling Social Intelligence: A Comparative Study of Human and AI Capabilities,"Junqi Wang, Chunhui Zhang, Jiapeng Li, Yuxi Ma, Lixing Niu, Jiaheng Han, Yujia Peng, Yixin Zhu, Lifeng Fan",2024-05-20,"Facing the current debate on whether Large Language Models (LLMs) attain near-human intelligence levels (Mitchell & Krakauer, 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023; Kosinski, 2023; Shiffrin & Mitchell, 2023; Ullman, 2023), the current study introduces a benchmark for evaluating social intelligence, one of the most distinctive aspects of human cognition. We developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for social dynamics and introduced two evaluation tasks: Inverse Reasoning (IR) and Inverse Inverse Planning (IIP). Our approach also encompassed a computational model based on recursive Bayesian inference, adept at elucidating diverse human behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses revealed that humans surpassed the latest GPT models in overall performance, zero-shot learning, one-shot generalization, and adaptability to multi-modalities. Notably, GPT models demonstrated social intelligence only at the most basic order (order = 0), in stark contrast to human social intelligence (order >= 2).

Human-Centered LLM-Agent User Interface: A Position Paper,"Daniel Chin, Yuxuan Wang, Gus Xia",2024-05-19,"Large Language Model (LLM) -in-the-loop applications have been shown to effectively interpret the human user's commands, make plans, and operate external tools/systems accordingly. Still, the operation scope of the LLM agent is limited to passively following the user, requiring the user to frame his/her needs with regard to the underlying tools/systems. We note that the potential of an LLM-Agent User Interface (LAUI) is much greater. A user mostly ignorant to the underlying tools/systems should be able to work with a LAUI to discover an emergent workflow. Contrary to the conventional way of designing an explorable GUI to teach the user a predefined set of ways to use the system, in the ideal LAUI, the LLM agent is initialized to be proficient with the system, proactively studies the user and his/her needs, and proposes new interaction schemes to the user. To illustrate LAUI, we present Flute X GPT, a concrete example using an LLM agent, a prompt manager, and a flute-tutoring multi-modal software-hardware system to facilitate the complex, real-time user experience of learning to play the flute.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13050v1
CPS-LLM: Large Language Model based Safe Usage Plan Generator for Human-in-the-Loop Human-in-the-Plant Cyber-Physical System,"Ayan Banerjee, Aranyak Maity, Payal Kamboj, Sandeep K. S. Gupta",2024-05-19,"We explore the usage of large language models (LLM) in human-in-the-loop human-in-the-plant cyber-physical systems (CPS) to translate a high-level prompt into a personalized plan of actions, and subsequently convert that plan into a grounded inference of sequential decision-making automated by a real-world CPS controller to achieve a control goal. We show that it is relatively straightforward to contextualize an LLM so it can generate domain-specific plans. However, these plans may be infeasible for the physical system to execute or the plan may be unsafe for human users. To address this, we propose CPS-LLM, an LLM retrained using an instruction tuning framework, which ensures that generated plans not only align with the physical system dynamics of the CPS but are also safe for human users. The CPS-LLM consists of two innovative components: a) a liquid time constant neural network-based physical dynamics coefficient estimator that can derive coefficients of dynamical models with some unmeasured state variables; b) the model coefficients are then used to train an LLM with prompts embodied with traces from the dynamical system and the corresponding model coefficients. We show that when the CPS-LLM is integrated with a contextualized chatbot such as BARD it can generate feasible and safe plans to manage external events such as meals for automated insulin delivery systems used by Type 1 Diabetes subjects.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11458v1
MapCoder: Multi-Agent Code Generation for Competitive Problem Solving,"Md.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in natural language processing, their performance in code generation tasks remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to code generation tasks leveraging multi-agent prompting that uniquely replicates the full cycle of program synthesis as observed in human developers. Our framework, MapCoder, consists of four LLM agents specifically designed to emulate the stages of this cycle: recalling relevant examples, planning, code generation, and debugging.

StoryVerse: Towards Co-authoring Dynamic Plot with LLM-based Character Simulation via Narrative Planning,"Yi Wang, Qian Zhou, David Ledo",2024-05-17,"Automated plot generation for games enhances the player's experience by providing rich and immersive narrative experience that adapts to the player's actions. Traditional approaches adopt a symbolic narrative planning method which limits the scale and complexity of the generated plot by requiring extensive knowledge engineering work. Recent advancements use Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive the behavior of virtual characters, allowing plots to emerge from interactions between characters and their environments. However, the emergent nature of such decentralized plot generation makes it difficult for authors to direct plot progression. We propose a novel plot creation workflow that mediates between a writer's authorial intent and the emergent behaviors from LLM-driven character simulation, through a novel authorial structure called ""abstract acts"". The writers define high-level plot outlines that are later transformed into concrete character action sequences via an LLM-based narrative planning process, based on the game world state. The process creates ""living stories"" that dynamically adapt to various game world states, resulting in narratives co-created by the author, character simulation, and player. We present StoryVerse as a proof-of-concept system to demonstrate this plot creation workflow. We showcase the versatility of our approach with examples in different stories and game environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13042v1

ALPINE: Unveiling the Planning Capability of Autoregressive Learning in Language Models,"Siwei Wang, Yifei Shen, Shi Feng, Haoran Sun, Shang-Hua Teng, Wei Chen",2024-05-15,"In this paper, we present the findings of our Project ALPINE which stands for ``Autoregressive Learning for Planning In NEtworks."" Project ALPINE initiates a theoretical investigation into the development of planning capabilities in Transformer-based language models through their autoregressive learning mechanisms, aiming to identify any potential limitations in their planning abilities. We abstract planning as a network path-finding task where the objective is to generate a valid path from a specified source node to a designated target node. In terms of expressiveness, we show that the Transformer is capable of executing path-finding by embedding the adjacency and reachability matrices within its weights. Our theoretical analysis of the gradient-based learning dynamic of the Transformer reveals that the Transformer is capable of learning both the adjacency matrix and a limited form of the reachability matrix. These theoretical insights are then validated through experiments, which demonstrate that the Transformer indeed learns the adjacency matrix and an incomplete reachability matrix, which aligns with the predictions made in our theoretical analysis. Additionally, when applying our methodology to a real-world planning benchmark, called Blocksworld, our observations remain consistent. Our theoretical and empirical analyses further unveil a potential limitation of Transformer in path-finding: it cannot identify reachability relationships through transitivity, and thus would fail when path concatenation is needed to generate a path. In summary, our findings shed new light on how the internal mechanisms of autoregressive learning enable planning in networks. This study may contribute to our understanding of the general planning capabilities in other related domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09220v2

In this study, we propose an agent-driven layout generation system using the GPT-4V multimodal large language model and validate its effectiveness. Specifically, the language model manipulates agents to sequentially place objects in the virtual space, thus generating layouts that reflect user instructions.

Integrating Intent Understanding and Optimal Behavior Planning for Behavior Tree Generation from Human Instructions,"Xinglin Chen, Yishuai Cai, Yunxin Mao, Minglong Li, Wenjing Yang, Weixia Xu, Ji Wang",2024-05-13,"Robots executing tasks following human instructions in domestic or industrial environments essentially require both adaptability and reliability. Behavior Tree (BT) emerges as an appropriate control architecture for these scenarios due to its modularity and reactivity. Existing BT generation methods, however, either do not involve interpreting natural language or cannot theoretically guarantee the BTs' success. This paper proposes a two-stage framework for BT generation, which first employs large language models (LLMs) to interpret goals from high-level instructions, then constructs an efficient goal-specific BT through the Optimal Behavior Tree Expansion Algorithm (OBTEA). We represent goals as well-formed formulas in first-order logic, effectively bridging intent understanding and optimal behavior planning. Experiments in the service robot validate the proficiency of LLMs in producing grammatically correct and accurately interpreted goals, demonstrate OBTEA's superiority over the baseline BT Expansion algorithm in various metrics, and finally confirm the practical deployability of our framework.

Chain of Thoughtlessness? An Analysis of CoT in Planning,"Kaya Stechly, Karthik Valmeekam, Subbarao Kambhampati",2024-05-08,"Large language model (LLM) performance on reasoning problems typically does not generalize out of distribution. Previous work has claimed that this can be mitigated with chain of thought prompting-a method of demonstrating solution procedures-with the intuition that it is possible to in-context teach an LLM an algorithm for solving the problem. This paper presents a case study of chain of thought on problems from Blocksworld, a classical planning domain, and examines the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs across two axes: generality of examples given in prompt, and complexity of problems queried with each prompt. While our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance improvements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly specific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly deteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of stacks shown in the examples. We also create scalable variants of three domains commonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of similar failure modes. Our results hint that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model learning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on carefully engineering highly problem specific prompts. This spotlights drawbacks of chain of thought, especially the sharp tradeoff between possible performance gains and the amount of human labor necessary to generate examples with correct reasoning traces.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04776v2
NL2Plan: Robust LLM-Driven Planning from Minimal Text Descriptions,"Elliot Gestrin, Marco Kuhlmann, Jendrik Seipp",2024-05-07,"Today's classical planners are powerful, but modeling input tasks in formats such as PDDL is tedious and error-prone. In contrast, planning with Large Language Models (LLMs) allows for almost any input text, but offers no guarantees on plan quality or even soundness. In an attempt to merge the best of these two approaches, some work has begun to use LLMs to automate parts of the PDDL creation process. However, these methods still require various degrees of expert input. We present NL2Plan, the first domain-agnostic offline LLM-driven planning system. NL2Plan uses an LLM to incrementally extract the necessary information from a short text prompt before creating a complete PDDL description of both the domain and the problem, which is finally solved by a classical planner. We evaluate NL2Plan on four planning domains and find that it solves 10 out of 15 tasks - a clear improvement over a plain chain-of-thought reasoning LLM approach, which only solves 2 tasks. Moreover, in two out of the five failure cases, instead of returning an invalid plan, NL2Plan reports that it failed to solve the task. In addition to using NL2Plan in end-to-end mode, users can inspect and correct all of its intermediate results, such as the PDDL representation, increasing explainability and making it an assistive tool for PDDL creation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04215v1

This is especially true for the logistics industry, where new technologies for data collection provide tremendous amounts of interconnected real-time data. The Intelligent Query and Learning System (IQLS) simplifies the process by allowing natural language use to simplify data retrieval . It maps structured data into a framework based on the available metadata and available data models. This framework creates an environment for an agent powered by a Large Language Model. The agent utilizes the hierarchical nature of the data to filter iteratively by making multiple small context-aware decisions instead of one-shot data retrieval. After the Data filtering, the IQLS enables the agent to fulfill tasks given by the user query through interfaces. These interfaces range from multimodal transportation information retrieval to route planning under multiple constraints. The latter lets the agent define a dynamic object, which is determined based on the query parameters. This object represents a driver capable of navigating a road network. The road network is depicted as a graph with attributes based on the data. Using a modified version of the Dijkstra algorithm, the optimal route under the given constraints can be determined.

In this study, we explored the application of ChatGPT, a state of the art large language model, to overcome these obstacles by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and profiling specific linguistic features indicative of autism. Leveraging ChatGPT advanced natural language processing capabilities, this research aims to streamline and refine the diagnostic process.

We showed that ChatGPT substantially outperformed these models, achieving over 13% improvement in both accuracy and F1 score in a zero shot learning configuration. This marked enhancement highlights the model potential as a superior tool for neurological diagnostics. Additionally, we identified ten distinct features of autism associated language disorders that vary significantly across different experimental scenarios. These features, which included echolalia, pronoun reversal, and atypical language usage, were crucial for accurately diagnosing ASD and customizing treatment plans.

Plan-Seq-Learn: Language Model Guided RL for Solving Long Horizon Robotics Tasks,"Murtaza Dalal, Tarun Chiruvolu, Devendra Chaplot, Ruslan Salakhutdinov",2024-05-02,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be capable of performing high-level planning for long-horizon robotics tasks, yet existing methods require access to a pre-defined skill library (e.g. picking, placing, pulling, pushing, navigating). However, LLM planning does not address how to design or learn those behaviors, which remains challenging particularly in long-horizon settings. Furthermore, for many tasks of interest, the robot needs to be able to adjust its behavior in a fine-grained manner, requiring the agent to be capable of modifying low-level control actions. Can we instead use the internet-scale knowledge from LLMs for high-level policies, guiding reinforcement learning (RL) policies to efficiently solve robotic control tasks online without requiring a pre-determined set of skills? In this paper, we propose Plan-Seq-Learn (PSL): a modular approach that uses motion planning to bridge the gap between abstract language and learned low-level control for solving long-horizon robotics tasks from scratch. We demonstrate that PSL achieves state-of-the-art results on over 25 challenging robotics tasks with up to 10 stages.

This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing an innovative study buddy we will be calling the 'SAMCares'. The system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) (in our case, LLaMa-2 70B as the base model) and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer real-time, context-aware, and adaptive educational support. The context of the model will be limited to the knowledge base of Sam Houston State University (SHSU) course notes. The LLM component enables a chat-like environment to interact with it to meet the unique learning requirements of each student. For this, we will build a custom web-based GUI. At the same time, RAG enhances real-time information retrieval and text generation, in turn providing more accurate and context-specific assistance. An option to upload additional study materials in the web GUI is added in case additional knowledge support is required. The system's efficacy will be evaluated through controlled trials and iterative feedback mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00330v1
HELPER-X: A Unified Instructable Embodied Agent to Tackle Four Interactive Vision-Language Domains with Memory-Augmented Language Models,"Gabriel Sarch, Sahil Somani, Raghav Kapoor, Michael J. Tarr, Katerina Fragkiadaki",2024-04-29,"Recent research on instructable agents has used memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) as task planners, a technique that retrieves language-program examples relevant to the input instruction and uses them as in-context examples in the LLM prompt to improve the performance of the LLM in inferring the correct action and task plans. In this technical report, we extend the capabilities of HELPER, by expanding its memory with a wider array of examples and prompts, and by integrating additional APIs for asking questions. This simple expansion of HELPER into a shared memory enables the agent to work across the domains of executing plans from dialogue, natural language instruction following, active question asking, and commonsense room reorganization. We evaluate the agent on four diverse interactive visual-language embodied agent benchmarks: ALFRED, TEACh, DialFRED, and the Tidy Task. HELPER-X achieves few-shot, state-of-the-art performance across these benchmarks using a single agent, without requiring in-domain training, and remains competitive with agents that have undergone in-domain training.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19065v1
Testing and Understanding Erroneous Planning in LLM Agents through Synthesized User Inputs,"Zhenlan Ji, Daoyuan Wu, Pingchuan Ma, Zongjie Li, Shuai Wang",2024-04-27,"Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in solving a wide range of tasks by integrating LLMs with key modules such as planning, memory, and tool usage. Increasingly, customers are adopting LLM agents across a variety of commercial applications critical to reliability, including support for mental well-being, chemical synthesis, and software development. Nevertheless, our observations and daily use of LLM agents indicate that they are prone to making erroneous plans, especially when the tasks are complex and require long-term planning.   In this paper, we propose PDoctor, a novel and automated approach to testing LLM agents and understanding their erroneous planning. As the first work in this direction, we formulate the detection of erroneous planning as a constraint satisfiability problem: an LLM agent's plan is considered erroneous if its execution violates the constraints derived from the user inputs. To this end, PDoctor first defines a domain-specific language (DSL) for user queries and synthesizes varying inputs with the assistance of the Z3 constraint solver. These synthesized inputs are natural language paragraphs that specify the requirements for completing a series of tasks. Then, PDoctor derives constraints from these requirements to form a testing oracle. We evaluate PDoctor with three mainstream agent frameworks and two powerful LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). The results show that PDoctor can effectively detect diverse errors in agent planning and provide insights and error characteristics that are valuable to both agent developers and users. We conclude by discussing potential alternative designs and directions to extend PDoctor.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17833v1
Large Language Model Agent as a Mechanical Designer,"Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani",2024-04-26,"Conventional mechanical design paradigms rely on experts systematically refining concepts through experience-guided modification and FEA to meet specific requirements. However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavily dependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learning models have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driven iterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data and considerable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deep learning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for which they were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. This creates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand for resources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integrates pre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design and provides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan, generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing the iterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reason about and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Our results reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate truss designs that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate of up to 90%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employing prompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibit optimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iteratively refine designs to meet specifications. This ability of LLM agents to produce viable designs and optimize them based on their inherent reasoning capabilities highlights their potential to develop and implement effective design strategies autonomously.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17525v2
"Adapting Open-Source Large Language Models for Cost-Effective, Expert-Level Clinical Note Generation with On-Policy Reinforcement Learning","Hanyin Wang, Chufan Gao, Bolun Liu, Qiping Xu, Guleid Hussein, Mohamad El Labban, Kingsley Iheasirim, Hariprasad Korsapati, Chuck Outcalt, Jimeng Sun",2024-04-25,"Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Gemini have demonstrated promising capabilities in clinical text summarization tasks. However, due to patient data privacy concerns and computational costs, many healthcare providers prefer using small, locally-hosted models over external generic LLMs. This study presents a comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the open-source LLaMA-2 13 billion parameter model, enabling it to generate high-quality clinical notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. Our process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced a new approach, DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini 1.0 Pro as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, can generate clinical notes comparable in quality to those authored by physicians. In a blinded physician reader study, the majority (90.4%) of individual evaluations rated the notes generated by LLaMA-Clinic as ""acceptable"" or higher across all three criteria: real-world readiness, completeness, and accuracy. In the more challenging ""Assessment and Plan"" section, LLaMA-Clinic scored higher (4.2/5) in real-world readiness than physician-authored notes (4.1/5). Our cost analysis for inference shows that our LLaMA-Clinic model achieves a 3.75-fold cost reduction compared to an external generic LLM service. Additionally, we highlight key considerations for future clinical note-generation tasks, emphasizing the importance of pre-defining a best-practice note format, rather than relying on LLMs to determine this for clinical practice. We have made our newly created synthetic clinic dialogue-note dataset and the physician feedback dataset publicly available to foster future research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00715v4

Integrating Disambiguation and User Preferences into Large Language Models for Robot Motion Planning,"Mohammed Abugurain, Shinkyu Park",2024-04-22,"This paper presents a framework that can interpret humans' navigation commands containing temporal elements and directly translate their natural language instructions into robot motion planning. Central to our framework is utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reliability of LLMs in the framework and improve user experience, we propose methods to resolve the ambiguity in natural language instructions and capture user preferences. The process begins with an ambiguity classifier, identifying potential uncertainties in the instructions. Ambiguous statements trigger a GPT-4-based mechanism that generates clarifying questions, incorporating user responses for disambiguation. Also, the framework assesses and records user preferences for non-ambiguous instructions, enhancing future interactions. The last part of this process is the translation of disambiguated instructions into a robot motion plan using Linear Temporal Logic.

LLM-Personalize: Aligning LLM Planners with Human Preferences via Reinforced Self-Training for Housekeeping Robots,"Dongge Han, Trevor McInroe, Adam Jelley, Stefano V. Albrecht, Peter Bell, Amos Storkey",2024-04-22,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing significantly improved alignment with human preferences.

Our approach draws inspiration from structured writing planning and reasoning paths, focusing on capturing and reflecting user intentions throughout the writing process. We construct a diverse dataset from unstructured blog posts to benchmark writing performance and introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework assessing the quality of outlines and generated texts. Our evaluations with GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and HyperCLOVA X demonstrate that the Writing Path approach significantly enhances text quality according to both LLMs and human evaluations.

Synthetic Participatory Planning of Shard Automated Electric Mobility Systems,"Jiangbo Yu, Graeme McKinley",2024-04-18,"Unleashing the synergies among rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder setting presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems.

These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with higher controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than that generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent.

Large Language Models Can Plan Your Travels Rigorously with Formal Verification Tools,"Yilun Hao, Yongchao Chen, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan",2024-04-18,"The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their abundant world knowledge and capabilities of tool-using and reasoning, fostered many LLM planning algorithms. However, LLMs have not shown to be able to accurately solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. In Xie et al. (2024), the authors proposed TravelPlanner, a U.S. domestic travel planning benchmark, and showed that LLMs themselves cannot make travel plans that satisfy user requirements with a best success rate of 0.6%. In this work, we propose a framework that enables LLMs to formally formulate and solve the travel planning problem as a satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) problem and use SMT solvers interactively and automatically solve the combinatorial search problem. The SMT solvers guarantee the satisfiable of input constraints and the LLMs can enable a language-based interaction with our framework. When the input constraints cannot be satisfiable, our LLM-based framework will interactively offer suggestions to users to modify their travel requirements via automatic reasoning using the SMT solvers. We evaluate our framework with TravelPlanner and achieve a success rate of 97%. We also create a separate dataset that contain international travel benchmarks and use both dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our interactive planning framework when the initial user queries cannot be satisfied. Our framework could generate valid plans with an average success rate of 78.6% for our dataset and 85.0% for TravelPlanner according to diverse humans preferences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11891v1
Thought of Search: Planning with Language Models Through The Lens of Efficiency,"Michael Katz, Harsha Kokel, Kavitha Srinivas, Shirin Sohrabi",2024-04-18,"Among the most important properties of algorithms investigated in computer science are soundness, completeness, and complexity. These properties, however, are rarely analyzed for the vast collection of recently proposed methods for planning with large language models. In this work, we alleviate this gap. We analyse these properties of using LLMs for planning and highlight that recent trends abandon both soundness and completeness for the sake of inefficiency. We propose a significantly more efficient approach that can, at the same time, maintain both soundness and completeness. We exemplify on four representative search problems, comparing to the LLM-based solutions from the literature that attempt to solve these problems. We show that by using LLMs to produce the code for the search components we can solve the entire datasets with 100\% accuracy with only a few calls to the LLM.

On the Empirical Complexity of Reasoning and Planning in LLMs,"Liwei Kang, Zirui Zhao, David Hsu, Wee Sun Lee",2024-04-17,"Chain-of-thought (CoT), tree-of-thought (ToT), and related techniques work surprisingly well in practice for some complex reasoning tasks with Large Language Models (LLMs), but why? This work seeks the underlying reasons by conducting experimental case studies and linking the performance benefits to well-established sample and computational complexity principles in machine learning. We experimented with 6 reasoning tasks, ranging from grade school math, air travel planning, ..., to Blocksworld. The results suggest that (i) both CoT and ToT benefit significantly from task decomposition, which breaks a complex reasoning task into a sequence of steps with low sample complexity and explicitly outlines the reasoning structure, and (ii) for computationally hard reasoning tasks, the more sophisticated tree structure of ToT outperforms the linear structure of CoT.

Empowering Large Language Models on Robotic Manipulation with Affordance Prompting,"Guangran Cheng, Chuheng Zhang, Wenzhe Cai, Li Zhao, Changyin Sun, Jiang Bian",2024-04-17,"While large language models (LLMs) are successful in completing various language processing tasks, they easily fail to interact with the physical world by generating control sequences properly. We find that the main reason is that LLMs are not grounded in the physical world. Existing LLM-based approaches circumvent this problem by relying on additional pre-defined skills or pre-trained sub-policies, making it hard to adapt to new tasks. In contrast, we aim to address this problem and explore the possibility to prompt pre-trained LLMs to accomplish a series of robotic manipulation tasks in a training-free paradigm. Accordingly, we propose a framework called LLM+A(ffordance) where the LLM serves as both the sub-task planner (that generates high-level plans) and the motion controller (that generates low-level control sequences). To ground these plans and control sequences on the physical world, we develop the affordance prompting technique that stimulates the LLM to 1) predict the consequences of generated plans and 2) generate affordance values for relevant objects. Empirically, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLM+A in various language-conditioned robotic manipulation tasks, which show that our approach substantially improves performance by enhancing the feasibility of generated plans and control and can easily generalize to different environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11027v1
COMBO: Compositional World Models for Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation,"Hongxin Zhang, Zeyuan Wang, Qiushi Lyu, Zheyuan Zhang, Sunli Chen, Tianmin Shu, Yilun Du, Chuang Gan",2024-04-16,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of embodied multi-agent cooperation, where decentralized agents must cooperate given only partial egocentric views of the world. To effectively plan in this setting, in contrast to learning world dynamics in a single-agent scenario, we must simulate world dynamics conditioned on an arbitrary number of agents' actions given only partial egocentric visual observations of the world. To address this issue of partial observability, we first train generative models to estimate the overall world state given partial egocentric observations. To enable accurate simulation of multiple sets of actions on this world state, we then propose to learn a compositional world model for multi-agent cooperation by factorizing the naturally composable joint actions of multiple agents and compositionally generating the video. By leveraging this compositional world model, in combination with Vision Language Models to infer the actions of other agents, we can use a tree search procedure to integrate these modules and facilitate online cooperative planning. To evaluate the efficacy of our methods, we create two challenging embodied multi-agent long-horizon cooperation tasks using the ThreeDWorld simulator and conduct experiments with 2-4 agents. The results show our compositional world model is effective and the framework enables the embodied agents to cooperate efficiently with different agents across various tasks and an arbitrary number of agents, showing the promising future of our proposed framework.

LLMSat: A Large Language Model-Based Goal-Oriented Agent for Autonomous Space Exploration,David Maranto,2024-04-13,"As spacecraft journey further from Earth with more complex missions, systems of greater autonomy and onboard intelligence are called for. Reducing reliance on human-based mission control becomes increasingly critical if we are to increase our rate of solar-system-wide exploration. Recent work has explored AI-based goal-oriented systems to increase the level of autonomy in mission execution. These systems make use of symbolic reasoning managers to make inferences from the state of a spacecraft and a handcrafted knowledge base, enabling autonomous generation of tasks and re-planning. Such systems have proven to be successful in controlled cases, but they are difficult to implement as they require human-crafted ontological models to allow the spacecraft to understand the world. Reinforcement learning has been applied to train robotic agents to pursue a goal. A new architecture for autonomy is called for. This work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the high-level control system of a spacecraft. Using a systems engineering approach, this work presents the design and development of an agentic spacecraft controller by leveraging an LLM as a reasoning engine, to evaluate the utility of such an architecture in achieving higher levels of spacecraft autonomy. A series of deep space mission scenarios simulated within the popular game engine Kerbal Space Program (KSP) are used as case studies to evaluate the implementation against the requirements. It is shown the reasoning and planning abilities of present-day LLMs do not scale well as the complexity of a mission increases, but this can be alleviated with adequate prompting frameworks and strategic selection of the agent's level of authority over the host spacecraft.

The motion planner is evaluated on the physical hardware of the two humanoid robots NICO and NICOL in a human-in-the-loop grasping scenario. Our method is deployed with an embodied agent that is a large language model (LLM) at its core. We generalize the embodied agent, that was introduced for NICOL, to also be embodied by NICO. The agent can execute a discrete set of physical actions and allows the user to verbally instruct various different robots. We contribute a grasping primitive to its action space that allows for precise manipulation of household objects. The new CycleIK method is compared to popular numerical IK solvers and state-of-the-art neural IK methods in simulation and is shown to be competitive with or outperform all evaluated methods when the algorithm runtime is very short.

Can Vehicle Motion Planning Generalize to Realistic Long-tail Scenarios?,"Marcel Hallgarten, Julian Zapata, Martin Stoll, Katrin Renz, Andreas Zell",2024-04-11,"Real-world autonomous driving systems must make safe decisions in the face of rare and diverse traffic scenarios.

This makes it difficult to judge a planner's capabilities to generalize to rarely-seen situations. Therefore, we propose a novel closed-loop benchmark interPlan containing several edge cases and challenging driving scenarios. We assess existing state-of-the-art planners on our benchmark and show that neither rule-based nor learning-based planners can safely navigate the interPlan scenarios.   A recently evolving direction is the usage of foundation models like large language models (LLM) to handle generalization.

However, the manual creation of these documents is not only time-consuming but also prone to inconsistencies and potential errors. The automation of this documentation process using artificial intelligence (AI) represents a promising area of innovation in healthcare. This study directly addresses the inefficiencies and inaccuracies in creating discharge notes manually, particularly for cardiac patients, by employing AI techniques, specifically large language model (LLM). Utilizing a substantial dataset from a cardiology center, encompassing wide-ranging medical records and physician assessments, our research evaluates the capability of LLM to enhance the documentation process. Among the various models assessed, Mistral-7B distinguished itself by accurately generating discharge notes that significantly improve both documentation efficiency and the continuity of care for patients. These notes underwent rigorous qualitative evaluation by medical expert, receiving high marks for their clinical relevance, completeness, readability, and contribution to informed decision-making and care planning. Coupled with quantitative analyses, these results confirm Mistral-7B's efficacy in distilling complex medical information into concise, coherent summaries. Overall, our findings illuminate the considerable promise of specialized LLM, such as Mistral-7B, in refining healthcare documentation workflows and advancing patient care.

Prompting Multi-Modal Tokens to Enhance End-to-End Autonomous Driving Imitation Learning with LLMs,"Yiqun Duan, Qiang Zhang, Renjing Xu",2024-04-07,"The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the realm of reinforcement learning, particularly as planners, has garnered a significant degree of attention in recent scholarly literature. However, a substantial proportion of existing research predominantly focuses on planning models for robotics that transmute the outputs derived from perception models into linguistic forms, thus adopting a `pure-language' strategy. In this research, we propose a hybrid End-to-End learning framework for autonomous driving by combining basic driving imitation learning with LLMs based on multi-modality prompt tokens. Instead of simply converting perception results from the separated train model into pure language input, our novelty lies in two aspects. 1) The end-to-end integration of visual and LiDAR sensory input into learnable multi-modality tokens, thereby intrinsically alleviating description bias by separated pre-trained perception models. 2) Instead of directly letting LLMs drive, this paper explores a hybrid setting of letting LLMs help the driving model correct mistakes and complicated scenarios. The results of our experiments suggest that the proposed methodology can attain driving scores of 49.21%, coupled with an impressive route completion rate of 91.34% in the offline evaluation conducted via CARLA. These performance metrics are comparable to the most advanced driving models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04869v1

However, the effectiveness of these models across all medical fields is uncertain. Each discipline presents unique challenges that need to be addressed for optimal performance. This complexity is further increased when attempting to integrate different fields into a single model. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to multimodal medical AI that utilizes the generalist capabilities of a large language model (LLM) as a central reasoning engine. This engine autonomously coordinates and deploys a set of specialized medical AI tools. These tools include text, radiology and histopathology image interpretation, genomic data processing, web searches, and document retrieval from medical guidelines. We validate our system across a series of clinical oncology scenarios that closely resemble typical patient care workflows. We show that the system has a high capability in employing appropriate tools (97%), drawing correct conclusions (93.6%), and providing complete (94%), and helpful (89.2%) recommendations for individual patient cases while consistently referencing relevant literature (82.5%) upon instruction. This work provides evidence that LLMs can effectively plan and execute domain-specific models to retrieve or synthesize new information when used as autonomous agents. This enables them to function as specialist, patient-tailored clinical assistants. It also simplifies regulatory compliance by allowing each component tool to be individually validated and approved.

Can only LLMs do Reasoning?: Potential of Small Language Models in Task Planning,"Gawon Choi, Hyemin Ahn",2024-04-05,"In robotics, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming prevalent, especially for understanding human commands. In particular, LLMs are utilized as domain-agnostic task planners for high-level human commands. LLMs are capable of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and this allows LLMs to be task planners. However, we need to consider that modern robots still struggle to perform complex actions, and the domains where robots can be deployed are limited in practice. This leads us to pose a question: If small LMs can be trained to reason in chains within a single domain, would even small LMs be good task planners for the robots? To train smaller LMs to reason in chains, we build `COmmand-STeps datasets' (COST) consisting of high-level commands along with corresponding actionable low-level steps, via LLMs. We release not only our datasets but also the prompt templates used to generate them, to allow anyone to build datasets for their domain. We compare GPT3.5 and GPT4 with the finetuned GPT2 for task domains, in tabletop and kitchen environments, and the result shows that GPT2-medium is comparable to GPT3.5 for task planning in a specific domain.

In particular, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into robot task and motion planning has been proven to be a game-changer, elevating performance in terms of explainability and downstream task efficiency to unprecedented heights. However, managing the vast knowledge encapsulated within these large models has posed challenges, often resulting in infeasible plans generated by LLM-based planning systems due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To overcome these challenges and obtain even greater planning feasibility and computational efficiency, we propose a novel LLM-driven task planning approach called DELTA. For achieving better grounding from environmental topology into actionable knowledge, DELTA leverages the power of scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, enabling the fast generation of precise planning problem descriptions. For obtaining higher planning performance, we use LLMs to decompose the long-term task goals into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals for an automated task planner to solve.

TwoStep: Multi-agent Task Planning using Classical Planners and Large Language Models,"Ishika Singh, David Traum, Jesse Thomason",2024-03-25,"Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, for example that two agents in the domain can execute an action simultaneously if postconditions of each do not interfere with preconditions of the other. A human expert can decompose a goal into largely independent constituent parts and assign each agent to one of these subgoals to take advantage of simultaneous actions for faster execution of plan steps, each using only single agent planning. By contrast, large language models (LLMs) used for directly inferring plan steps do not guarantee execution success, but do leverage commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. We combine the strengths of classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for two-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone and preserving execution success. Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of subgoals can achieve similar multi-agent execution steps than those specified by human experts.

"RepairAgent: An Autonomous, LLM-Based Agent for Program Repair","Islem Bouzenia, Premkumar Devanbu, Michael Pradel",2024-03-25,"Automated program repair has emerged as a powerful technique to mitigate the impact of software bugs on system reliability and user experience. This paper introduces RepairAgent, the first work to address the program repair challenge through an autonomous agent based on a large language model (LLM). Unlike existing deep learning-based approaches, which prompt a model with a fixed prompt or in a fixed feedback loop, our work treats the LLM as an agent capable of autonomously planning and executing actions to fix bugs by invoking suitable tools. RepairAgent freely interleaves gathering information about the bug, gathering repair ingredients, and validating fixes, while deciding which tools to invoke based on the gathered information and feedback from previous fix attempts. Key contributions that enable RepairAgent include a set of tools that are useful for program repair, a dynamically updated prompt format that allows the LLM to interact with these tools, and a finite state machine that guides the agent in invoking the tools. Our evaluation on the popular Defects4J dataset demonstrates RepairAgent's effectiveness in autonomously repairing 164 bugs, including 39 bugs not fixed by prior techniques. Interacting with the LLM imposes an average cost of 270,000 tokens per bug, which, under the current pricing of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, translates to 14 cents of USD per bug.

Grounding Language Plans in Demonstrations Through Counterfactual Perturbations,"Yanwei Wang, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Jiayuan Mao, Michael Hagenow, Julie Shah",2024-03-25,"Grounding the common-sense reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) in physical domains remains a pivotal yet unsolved problem for embodied AI. Whereas prior works have focused on leveraging LLMs directly for planning in symbolic spaces, this work uses LLMs to guide the search of task structures and constraints implicit in multi-step demonstrations. Specifically, we borrow from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, which group robot configurations by specific motion constraints, to serve as an abstraction layer between the high-level language representations of an LLM and the low-level physical trajectories of a robot. By replaying a few human demonstrations with synthetic perturbations, we generate coverage over the demonstrations' state space with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains an end-to-end differentiable neural network to predict successful trajectories from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states and images in mode families without dense labeling. The learned grounding classifiers can further be used to translate language plans into reactive policies in the physical domain in an interpretable manner. We show our approach improves the interpretability and reactivity of imitation learning through 2D navigation and simulated and real robot manipulation tasks.

Hallucination Detection in Foundation Models for Decision-Making: A Flexible Definition and Review of the State of the Art,"Neeloy Chakraborty, Melkior Ornik, Katherine Driggs-Campbell",2024-03-25,"Autonomous systems are soon to be ubiquitous, from manufacturing autonomy to agricultural field robots, and from health care assistants to the entertainment industry. The majority of these systems are developed with modular sub-components for decision-making, planning, and control that may be hand-engineered or learning-based. While these existing approaches have been shown to perform well under the situations they were specifically designed for, they can perform especially poorly in rare, out-of-distribution scenarios that will undoubtedly arise at test-time. The rise of foundation models trained on multiple tasks with impressively large datasets from a variety of fields has led researchers to believe that these models may provide common sense reasoning that existing planners are missing. Researchers posit that this common sense reasoning will bridge the gap between algorithm development and deployment to out-of-distribution tasks, like how humans adapt to unexpected scenarios. Large language models have already penetrated the robotics and autonomous systems domains as researchers are scrambling to showcase their potential use cases in deployment. While this application direction is very promising empirically, foundation models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may sound reasonable, but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back and simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model's decision, and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the current use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a general definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing approaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision problems, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16527v1
Explore until Confident: Efficient Exploration for Embodied Question Answering,"Allen Z. Ren, Jaden Clark, Anushri Dixit, Masha Itkina, Anirudha Majumdar, Dorsa Sadigh",2024-03-23,"We consider the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA), which refers to settings where an embodied agent such as a robot needs to actively explore an environment to gather information until it is confident about the answer to a question. In this work, we leverage the strong semantic reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) to efficiently explore and answer such questions. However, there are two main challenges when using VLMs in EQA: they do not have an internal memory for mapping the scene to be able to plan how to explore over time, and their confidence can be miscalibrated and can cause the robot to prematurely stop exploration or over-explore. We propose a method that first builds a semantic map of the scene based on depth information and via visual prompting of a VLM - leveraging its vast knowledge of relevant regions of the scene for exploration. Next, we use conformal prediction to calibrate the VLM's question answering confidence, allowing the robot to know when to stop exploration - leading to a more calibrated and efficient exploration strategy. To test our framework in simulation, we also contribute a new EQA dataset with diverse, realistic human-robot scenarios and scenes built upon the Habitat-Matterport 3D Research Dataset (HM3D). Both simulated and real robot experiments show our proposed approach improves the performance and efficiency over baselines that do no leverage VLM for exploration or do not calibrate its confidence.

SRLM: Human-in-Loop Interactive Social Robot Navigation with Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Weizheng Wang, Le Mao, Ruiqi Wang, Byung-Cheol Min",2024-03-22,"An interactive social robotic assistant must provide services in complex and crowded spaces while adapting its behavior based on real-time human language commands or feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach called Social Robot Planner (SRLM), which integrates Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to navigate through human-filled public spaces and provide multiple social services. SRLM infers global planning from human-in-loop commands in real-time, and encodes social information into a LLM-based large navigation model (LNM) for low-level motion execution. Moreover, a DRL-based planner is designed to maintain benchmarking performance, which is blended with LNM by a large feedback model (LFM) to address the instability of current text and LLM-driven LNM. Finally, SRLM demonstrates outstanding performance in extensive experiments. More details about this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/navi-srlm",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15648v1
CACA Agent: Capability Collaboration based AI Agent,"Peng Xu, Haoran Wang, Chuang Wang, Xu Liu",2024-03-22,"As AI Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in practical applications across various fields, how to quickly deploy an AI agent and how to conveniently expand the application scenario of AI agents has become a challenge. Previous studies mainly focused on implementing all the reasoning capabilities of AI agents within a single LLM, which often makes the model more complex and also reduces the extensibility of AI agent functionality. In this paper, we propose CACA Agent (Capability Collaboration based AI Agent), using an open architecture inspired by service computing. CACA Agent integrates a set of collaborative capabilities to implement AI Agents, not only reducing the dependence on a single LLM, but also enhancing the extensibility of both the planning abilities and the tools available to AI agents.

PARAMANU-AYN: An Efficient Novel Generative and Instruction-tuned Language Model for Indian Legal Case Documents,"Mitodru Niyogi, Arnab Bhattacharya",2024-03-20,"In this paper, we present PARAMANU-AYN, a language model based exclusively on case documents of the Supreme Court of India, the Constitution of India, and the Indian Penal Code. The novel Auto Regressive (AR) decoder based model is pretrained from scratch at a context size of 8192. We evaluated our pretrained legal model on perplexity metrics. We also instruction-tuned our pretrained model on a set of 10,763 instructions covering various legal tasks such as legal reasoning, judgement explanation, legal clause generation, legal drafting, legal contract drafting, case summarization, constitutional question-answering, etc. We also evaluated the responses of prompts for instruction-tuned models by GPT-3.5-Turbo on clarity, relevance, completeness, and legal reasoning metrics in a scale of 10. Our model can be run on CPU and achieved 42.46 tokens/sec CPU inference speed. We found that our models, despite not being pretrained on legal books, various legal contracts, and legal documents, were able to learn the domain knowledge required for drafting various legal contracts and legal clauses, and generalize to draft legal contracts and legal clauses with limited instruction tuning. Hence, we conclude that for a strong domain-specialized generative language model (such as legal), very large amounts of data are not required to develop models from scratch. We believe that this work is the first attempt to make a dedicated generative legal language model from scratch for Indian Supreme Court jurisdiction or in legal NLP overall.

No more optimization rules: LLM-enabled policy-based multi-modal query optimizer,"Yifan Wang, Haodi Ma, Daisy Zhe Wang",2024-03-20,"Large language model (LLM) has marked a pivotal moment in the field of machine learning and deep learning. Recently its capability for query planning has been investigated, including both single-modal and multi-modal queries. However, there is no work on the query optimization capability of LLM. As a critical (or could even be the most important) step that significantly impacts the execution performance of the query plan, such analysis and attempts should not be missed. From another aspect, existing query optimizers are usually rule-based or rule-based + cost-based, i.e., they are dependent on manually created rules to complete the query plan rewrite/transformation. Given the fact that modern optimizers include hundreds to thousands of rules, designing a multi-modal query optimizer following a similar way is significantly time-consuming since we will have to enumerate as many multi-modal optimization rules as possible, which has not been well addressed today. In this paper, we investigate the query optimization ability of LLM and use LLM to design LaPuda, a novel LLM and Policy based multi-modal query optimizer. Instead of enumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract policies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort are saved. Furthermore, to prevent LLM from making mistakes or negative optimization, we borrow the idea of gradient descent and propose a guided cost descent (GCD) algorithm to perform the optimization, such that the optimization can be kept in the correct direction. In our evaluation, our methods consistently outperform the baselines in most cases. For example, the optimized plans generated by our methods result in 1~3x higher execution speed than those by the baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13597v2

Our approach consists of a detection prompting toolkit inspired by high-precision detection priors and a new Chain-of-Thought to implement these prompts. Specifically, the prompts in the toolkit are designed to guide the MLLM to focus on regional information (e.g., zooming in), read coordinates according to measure standards (e.g., overlaying rulers and compasses), and infer from the contextual information (e.g., overlaying scene graphs). Building upon these tools, the new detection chain-of-thought can automatically decompose the task into simple subtasks, diagnose the predictions, and plan for progressive box refinements. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated across a spectrum of detection tasks, especially hard cases. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, GPT-4V with our DetToolChain improves state-of-the-art object detectors by +21.5% AP50 on MS COCO Novel class set for open-vocabulary detection, +24.23% Acc on RefCOCO val set for zero-shot referring expression comprehension, +14.5% AP on D-cube describe object detection FULL setting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12488v3
Embodied LLM Agents Learn to Cooperate in Organized Teams,"Xudong Guo, Kaixuan Huang, Jiale Liu, Wenhui Fan, Natalia Vélez, Qingyun Wu, Huazheng Wang, Thomas L. Griffiths, Mengdi Wang",2024-03-19,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as integral tools for reasoning, planning, and decision-making, drawing upon their extensive world knowledge and proficiency in language-related tasks. LLMs thus hold tremendous potential for natural language interaction within multi-agent systems to foster cooperation.

Inspired by human organizations, this paper introduces a framework that imposes prompt-based organization structures on LLM agents to mitigate these problems. Through a series of experiments with embodied LLM agents and human-agent collaboration, our results highlight the impact of designated leadership on team efficiency, shedding light on the leadership qualities displayed by LLM agents and their spontaneous cooperative behaviors.

Leveraging Large Language Models to Extract Information on Substance Use Disorder Severity from Clinical Notes: A Zero-shot Learning Approach,"Maria Mahbub, Gregory M. Dams, Sudarshan Srinivasan, Caitlin Rizy, Ioana Danciu, Jodie Trafton, Kathryn Knight",2024-03-18,"Substance use disorder (SUD) poses a major concern due to its detrimental effects on health and society. SUD identification and treatment depend on a variety of factors such as severity, co-determinants (e.g., withdrawal symptoms), and social determinants of health. Existing diagnostic coding systems used by American insurance providers, like the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), lack granularity for certain diagnoses, but clinicians will add this granularity (as that found within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders classification or DSM-5) as supplemental unstructured text in clinical notes. Traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods face limitations in accurately parsing such diverse clinical language. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in overcoming these challenges by adapting to diverse language patterns. This study investigates the application of LLMs for extracting severity-related information for various SUD diagnoses from clinical notes. We propose a workflow employing zero-shot learning of LLMs with carefully crafted prompts and post-processing techniques. Through experimentation with Flan-T5, an open-source LLM, we demonstrate its superior recall compared to the rule-based approach. Focusing on 11 categories of SUD diagnoses, we show the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting severity information, contributing to improved risk assessment and treatment planning for SUD patients.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12297v1

These domain-specific and labor-intensive modules are limited in addressing emerging tasks in real-world settings. Here, we present LLM^3, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based TAMP framework featuring a domain-independent interface. Specifically, we leverage the powerful reasoning and planning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to propose symbolic action sequences and select continuous action parameters for motion planning. Crucially, LLM^3 incorporates motion planning feedback through prompting, allowing the LLM to iteratively refine its proposals by reasoning about motion failure. Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion planning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain-specific messages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP problems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters. Ablation studies underscore the significant contribution of motion failure reasoning to the success of LLM^3.

Scene-LLM adopts a hybrid 3D visual feature representation, that incorporates dense spatial information and supports scene state updates. The model employs a projection layer to efficiently project these features in the pre-trained textual embedding space, enabling effective interpretation of 3D visual information. Unique to our approach is the integration of both scene-level and ego-centric 3D information. This combination is pivotal for interactive planning, where scene-level data supports global planning and ego-centric data is important for localization. Notably, we use ego-centric 3D frame features for feature alignment, an efficient technique that enhances the model's ability to align features of small objects within the scene. Our experiments with Scene-LLM demonstrate its strong capabilities in dense captioning, question answering, and interactive planning.

GOMA formulates verbal communication as a planning problem that minimizes the misalignment between the parts of agents' mental states that are relevant to the goals. This approach enables an embodied assistant to reason about when and how to proactively initialize communication with humans verbally using natural language to help achieve better cooperation. We evaluate our approach against strong baselines in two challenging environments, Overcooked (a multiplayer game) and VirtualHome (a household simulator).

USimAgent: Large Language Models for Simulating Search Users,"Erhan Zhang, Xingzhu Wang, Peiyuan Gong, Yankai Lin, Jiaxin Mao",2024-03-14,"Due to the advantages in the cost-efficiency and reproducibility, user simulation has become a promising solution to the user-centric evaluation of information retrieval systems. Nonetheless, accurately simulating user search behaviors has long been a challenge, because users' actions in search are highly complex and driven by intricate cognitive processes such as learning, reasoning, and planning. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarked potential in simulating human-level intelligence and have been used in building autonomous agents for various tasks. However, the potential of using LLMs in simulating search behaviors has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we introduce a LLM-based user search behavior simulator, USimAgent. The proposed simulator can simulate users' querying, clicking, and stopping behaviors during search, and thus, is capable of generating complete search sessions for specific search tasks. Empirical investigation on a real user behavior dataset shows that the proposed simulator outperforms existing methods in query generation and is comparable to traditional methods in predicting user clicks and stopping behaviors.

Teaching Machines to Code: Smart Contract Translation with LLMs,"Rabimba Karanjai, Lei Xu, Weidong Shi",2024-03-13,"The advent of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant milestone in the realm of artificial intelligence, with their capabilities often matching or surpassing human expertise in various domains. Among these achievements, their adeptness in translation tasks stands out, closely mimicking the intricate and preliminary processes undertaken by human translators to ensure the fidelity and quality of the translated content. Despite the advancements in utilizing LLMs for translating programming code across different languages, the domain of smart contract translation, particularly into languages not previously encountered by the LLM, remains largely unexplored. In our research, we present a pioneering approach, SolMover, which harnesses the synergy of two distinct LLMs within a unified framework. This framework is designed to grasp coding principles and apply this understanding to the translation of code into an unfamiliar language. Our study delves into the capacity of LLMs to mimic human learning processes, offering an in-depth evaluation of our methodology for converting smart contracts written in Solidity to Move, a language with limited resources. The framework employs one LLM to decipher coding conventions for the new language, creating a blueprint for the second LLM, which, lacking planning abilities, possesses coding expertise.

ArgMed-Agents: Explainable Clinical Decision Reasoning with LLM Disscusion via Argumentation Schemes,"Shengxin Hong, Liang Xiao, Xin Zhang, Jianxia Chen",2024-03-10,"There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning. Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations. Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's cognitive processes. This leads to user distrust. In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction. ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Discussion (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships. Ultimately, use symbolic solver to identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision. We construct a formal model of ArgMed-Agents and present conjectures for theoretical guarantees. ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner. The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06294v2

Meanwhile, many robotics applications involve human supervisors or collaborators. Hence, it is crucial for LLMs to generate socially acceptable actions that align with people's preferences and values. In this work, we test whether LLMs capture people's intuitions about behavior judgments and communication preferences in human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. For evaluation, we reproduce three HRI user studies, comparing the output of LLMs with that of real participants. We find that GPT-4 strongly outperforms other models, generating answers that correlate strongly with users' answers in two studies $\unicode{x2014}$ the first study dealing with selecting the most appropriate communicative act for a robot in various situations ($r_s$ = 0.82), and the second with judging the desirability, intentionality, and surprisingness of behavior ($r_s$ = 0.83).

We find that GPT-4 can play the game to a passable degree: it is able to manipulate doors, combat enemies, and perform pathing. More complex prompting strategies involving multiple model calls provide better results. While further work is required to enable the LLM to play the game as well as its classical, reinforcement learning-based counterparts, we note that GPT-4 required no training, leaning instead on its own reasoning and observational capabilities.

By reviewing the link between generative and discriminative modeling, we posit that T2I models' discriminative abilities may reflect their text-image alignment proficiency during generation. In this light, we advocate bolstering the discriminative abilities of T2I models to achieve more precise text-to-image alignment for generation. We present a discriminative adapter built on T2I models to probe their discriminative abilities on two representative tasks and leverage discriminative fine-tuning to improve their text-image alignment. As a bonus of the discriminative adapter, a self-correction mechanism can leverage discriminative gradients to better align generated images to text prompts during inference.

To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents.

In this work, we point out that State CHangEs MAtter (SCHEMA) for procedure planning in instructional videos. We aim to establish a more structured state space by investigating the causal relations between steps and states in procedures. Specifically, we explicitly represent each step as state changes and track the state changes in procedures. For step representation, we leveraged the commonsense knowledge in large language models (LLMs) to describe the state changes of steps via our designed chain-of-thought prompting. For state change tracking, we align visual state observations with language state descriptions via cross-modal contrastive learning, and explicitly model the intermediate states of the procedure using LLM-generated state descriptions.

SceneCraft: An LLM Agent for Synthesizing 3D Scene as Blender Code,"Ziniu Hu, Ahmet Iscen, Aashi Jain, Thomas Kipf, Yisong Yue, David A. Ross, Cordelia Schmid, Alireza Fathi",2024-03-02,"This paper introduces SceneCraft, a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent converting text descriptions into Blender-executable Python scripts which render complex scenes with up to a hundred 3D assets. This process requires complex spatial planning and arrangement. We tackle these challenges through a combination of advanced abstraction, strategic planning, and library learning. SceneCraft first models a scene graph as a blueprint, detailing the spatial relationships among assets in the scene. SceneCraft then writes Python scripts based on this graph, translating relationships into numerical constraints for asset layout. Next, SceneCraft leverages the perceptual strengths of vision-language foundation models like GPT-V to analyze rendered images and iteratively refine the scene. On top of this process, SceneCraft features a library learning mechanism that compiles common script functions into a reusable library, facilitating continuous self-improvement without expensive LLM parameter tuning. Our evaluation demonstrates that SceneCraft surpasses existing LLM-based agents in rendering complex scenes, as shown by its adherence to constraints and favorable human assessments. We also showcase the broader application potential of SceneCraft by reconstructing detailed 3D scenes from the Sintel movie and guiding a video generative model with generated scenes as intermediary control signal.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01248v1
Playing NetHack with LLMs: Potential & Limitations as Zero-Shot Agents,"Dominik Jeurissen, Diego Perez-Liebana, Jeremy Gow, Duygu Cakmak, James Kwan",2024-03-01,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success as high-level planners for zero-shot game-playing agents. However, these agents are primarily evaluated on Minecraft, where long-term planning is relatively straightforward. In contrast, agents tested in dynamic robot environments face limitations due to simplistic environments with only a few objects and interactions. To fill this gap in the literature, we present NetPlay, the first LLM-powered zero-shot agent for the challenging roguelike NetHack. NetHack is a particularly challenging environment due to its diverse set of items and monsters, complex interactions, and many ways to die.   NetPlay uses an architecture designed for dynamic robot environments, modified for NetHack. Like previous approaches, it prompts the LLM to choose from predefined skills and tracks past interactions to enhance decision-making. Given NetHack's unpredictable nature, NetPlay detects important game events to interrupt running skills, enabling it to react to unforeseen circumstances. While NetPlay demonstrates considerable flexibility and proficiency in interacting with NetHack's mechanics, it struggles with ambiguous task descriptions and a lack of explicit feedback. Our findings demonstrate that NetPlay performs best with detailed context information, indicating the necessity for dynamic methods in supplying context information for complex games such as NetHack.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00690v1

Recently, we are witnessing a rising trend that utilizes various deep-learning methods to facilitate cross-domain data fusion in smart cities. To this end, we propose the first survey that systematically reviews the latest advancements in deep learning-based data fusion methods tailored for urban computing. Specifically, we first delve into data perspective to comprehend the role of each modality and data source. Secondly, we classify the methodology into four primary categories: feature-based, alignment-based, contrast-based, and generation-based fusion methods. Thirdly, we further categorize multi-modal urban applications into seven types: urban planning, transportation, economy, public safety, society, environment, and energy. Compared with previous surveys, we focus more on the synergy of deep learning methods with urban computing applications.

In embodied tasks, high-level planning is amenable to direct coding, while low-level actions often necessitate task-specific refinement, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL). To seamlessly integrate both modalities, we introduce a two-level hierarchical framework, RL-GPT, comprising a slow agent and a fast agent. The slow agent analyzes actions suitable for coding, while the fast agent executes coding tasks. This decomposition effectively focuses each agent on specific tasks, proving highly efficient within our pipeline.

Large Language Models are Learnable Planners for Long-Term Recommendation,"Wentao Shi, Xiangnan He, Yang Zhang, Chongming Gao, Xinyue Li, Jizhi Zhang, Qifan Wang, Fuli Feng",2024-02-29,"Planning for both immediate and long-term benefits becomes increasingly important in recommendation. Existing methods apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn planning capacity by maximizing cumulative reward for long-term recommendation. However, the scarcity of recommendation data presents challenges such as instability and susceptibility to overfitting when training RL models from scratch, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this light, we propose to leverage the remarkable planning capabilities over sparse data of Large Language Models (LLMs) for long-term recommendation. The key to achieving the target lies in formulating a guidance plan following principles of enhancing long-term engagement and grounding the plan to effective and executable actions in a personalized manner. To this end, we propose a Bi-level Learnable LLM Planner framework, which consists of a set of LLM instances and breaks down the learning process into macro-learning and micro-learning to learn macro-level guidance and micro-level personalized recommendation policies, respectively.

Pragmatic Instruction Following and Goal Assistance via Cooperative Language-Guided Inverse Planning,"Tan Zhi-Xuan, Lance Ying, Vikash Mansinghka, Joshua B. Tenenbaum",2024-02-27,"People often give instructions whose meaning is ambiguous without further context, expecting that their actions or goals will disambiguate their intentions. How can we build assistive agents that follow such instructions in a flexible, context-sensitive manner? This paper introduces cooperative language-guided inverse plan search (CLIPS), a Bayesian agent architecture for pragmatic instruction following and goal assistance. Our agent assists a human by modeling them as a cooperative planner who communicates joint plans to the assistant, then performs multimodal Bayesian inference over the human's goal from actions and language, using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the likelihood of an instruction given a hypothesized plan. Given this posterior, our assistant acts to minimize expected goal achievement cost, enabling it to pragmatically follow ambiguous instructions and provide effective assistance even when uncertain about the goal. We evaluate these capabilities in two cooperative planning domains (Doors, Keys & Gems and VirtualHome), finding that CLIPS significantly outperforms GPT-4V, LLM-based literal instruction following and unimodal inverse planning in both accuracy and helpfulness, while closely matching the inferences and assistive judgments provided by human raters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17930v1

While automated pipelines are enabled to resolve the most frequent and easy incidents, there still exist complex incidents that require OCEs' intervention. However, TSGs are often unstructured and incomplete, which requires manual interpretation by OCEs, leading to on-call fatigue and decreased productivity, especially among new-hire OCEs. In this work, we propose Nissist which leverages TSGs and incident mitigation histories to provide proactive suggestions, reducing human intervention. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM), Nissist extracts insights from unstructured TSGs and historical incident mitigation discussions, forming a comprehensive knowledge base. Its multi-agent system design enhances proficiency in precisely discerning user queries, retrieving relevant information, and delivering systematic plans consecutively.

Large Language Model for Participatory Urban Planning,"Zhilun Zhou, Yuming Lin, Depeng Jin, Yong Li",2024-02-27,"Participatory urban planning is the mainstream of modern urban planning that involves the active engagement of residents. However, the traditional participatory paradigm requires experienced planning experts and is often time-consuming and costly. Fortunately, the emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable ability to simulate human-like agents, which can be used to emulate the participatory process easily. In this work, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration framework for participatory urban planning, which can generate land-use plans for urban regions considering the diverse needs of residents. Specifically, we construct LLM agents to simulate a planner and thousands of residents with diverse profiles and backgrounds. We first ask the planner to carry out an initial land-use plan. To deal with the different facilities needs of residents, we initiate a discussion among the residents in each community about the plan, where residents provide feedback based on their profiles. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of discussion, we adopt a fishbowl discussion mechanism, where part of the residents discuss and the rest of them act as listeners in each round. Finally, we let the planner modify the plan based on residents' feedback. We deploy our method on two real-world regions in Beijing. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in residents satisfaction and inclusion metrics, and also outperforms human experts in terms of service accessibility and ecology metrics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17161v1

However, they have not been equally leveraged: language models have had significant real-world impact, whereas video generation has remained largely limited to media entertainment. Yet video data captures important information about the physical world that is difficult to express in language. To address this gap, we discuss an under-appreciated opportunity to extend video generation to solve tasks in the real world. We observe how, akin to language, video can serve as a unified interface that can absorb internet knowledge and represent diverse tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how, like language models, video generation can serve as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators through techniques such as in-context learning, planning and reinforcement learning. We identify major impact opportunities in domains such as robotics, self-driving, and science, supported by recent work that demonstrates how such advanced capabilities in video generation are plausibly within reach.

How Can LLM Guide RL? A Value-Based Approach,"Shenao Zhang, Sirui Zheng, Shuqi Ke, Zhihan Liu, Wanxin Jin, Jianbo Yuan, Yingxiang Yang, Hongxia Yang, Zhaoran Wang",2024-02-25,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the de facto standard practice for sequential decision-making problems by improving future acting policies with feedback. However, RL algorithms may require extensive trial-and-error interactions to collect useful feedback for improvement. On the other hand, recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have showcased impressive capabilities in language understanding and generation, yet they fall short in exploration and self-improvement capabilities for planning tasks, lacking the ability to autonomously refine their responses based on feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we study how the policy prior provided by the LLM can enhance the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. Specifically, we develop an algorithm named LINVIT that incorporates LLM guidance as a regularization factor in value-based RL, leading to significant reductions in the amount of data needed for learning, particularly when the difference between the ideal policy and the LLM-informed policy is small, which suggests that the initial policy is close to optimal, reducing the need for further exploration. Additionally, we present a practical algorithm SLINVIT that simplifies the construction of the value function and employs subgoals to reduce the search complexity.

This plan outlines the feasible tools and the maximum number of times they can be employed, offering a comprehensive overview of the tool learning process for large language models. This allows them to allocate the budget from a broader perspective. To devise the plan without incurring significant extra costs, we suggest initially estimating the usefulness of the candidate tools based on past experience. Subsequently, we employ dynamic programming to formulate the plan. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be integrated with various tool learning methods, significantly enhancing their effectiveness under strict budget constraints.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15960v2

While humans naturally expand their action spaces and develop skills through experiential learning, LLM agents typically operate within fixed action spaces, limiting their potential for growth. To address these challenges, our study explores open-action learning for language agents. We introduce a framework LearnAct with an iterative learning strategy to create and improve actions in the form of Python functions. In each iteration, LLM revises and updates the currently available actions based on the errors identified in unsuccessful training tasks, thereby enhancing action effectiveness. Our experimental evaluations across Robotic Planning and Alfworld environments reveal that after learning on a few training task instances, our approach to open-action learning markedly improves agent performance for the type of task (by 32 percent in AlfWorld compared to ReAct+Reflexion, for instance) highlighting the importance of experiential action learning in the development of more intelligent LLM agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15809v1

Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to apply their capabilities at various locations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack mission completion guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a new decentralized LLM-based planner, called S-ATLAS for Safe plAnning for Teams of Language-instructed AgentS, that is capable of achieving user-defined mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent uncertainty in a decentralized fashion, enabling robots to make individual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve user-specified task success rates while minimizing the overall number of help requests.

While progress has been made on simple reasoning problems, solving classical constraint satisfaction problems, such as the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) and Graph Coloring Problem (GCP), remains difficult for off-the-shelf solvers due to their intricate expressions and exponential search spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel differential logic layer-aided language modeling (DiLA) approach, where logical constraints are integrated into the forward and backward passes of a network layer, to provide another option for LLM tool learning. In DiLA, LLM aims to transform the language description to logic constraints and identify initial solutions of the highest quality, while the differential logic layer focuses on iteratively refining the LLM-prompted solution.

Its main aim was to develop spelling and grammar correction tools for the Estonian language. The main challenge was the very small amount of available error correction data needed for such development. To mitigate this, (1) we annotated more correction data for model training and testing, (2) we tested transfer-learning, i.e. retraining machine learning models created for other tasks, so as not to depend solely on correction data, (3) we compared the developed method and model with alternatives, including large language models. We also developed automatic evaluation, which can calculate the accuracy and yield of corrections by error category, so that the effectiveness of different methods can be compared in detail.

When is Tree Search Useful for LLM Planning? It Depends on the Discriminator,"Ziru Chen, Michael White, Raymond Mooney, Ali Payani, Yu Su, Huan Sun",2024-02-16,"In this paper, we examine how large language models (LLMs) solve multi-step problems under a language agent framework with three components: a generator, a discriminator, and a planning method. We investigate the practical utility of two advanced planning methods, iterative correction and tree search. We present a comprehensive analysis of how discrimination accuracy affects the overall performance of agents when using these two methods or a simpler method, re-ranking. Experiments on two tasks, text-to-SQL parsing and mathematical reasoning, show that: (1) advanced planning methods demand discriminators with at least 90% accuracy to achieve significant improvements over re-ranking; (2) current LLMs' discrimination abilities have not met the needs of advanced planning methods to achieve such improvements; (3) with LLM-based discriminators, advanced planning methods may not adequately balance accuracy and efficiency.

AutoGPT+P: Affordance-based Task Planning with Large Language Models,"Timo Birr, Christoph Pohl, Abdelrahman Younes, Tamim Asfour",2024-02-16,"Recent advances in task planning leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve generalizability by combining such models with classical planning algorithms to address their inherent limitations in reasoning capabilities. However, these approaches face the challenge of dynamically capturing the initial state of the task planning problem. To alleviate this issue, we propose AutoGPT+P, a system that combines an affordance-based scene representation with a planning system. Affordances encompass the action possibilities of an agent on the environment and objects present in it. Thus, deriving the planning domain from an affordance-based scene representation allows symbolic planning with arbitrary objects. AutoGPT+P leverages this representation to derive and execute a plan for a task specified by the user in natural language. In addition to solving planning tasks under a closed-world assumption, AutoGPT+P can also handle planning with incomplete information, e. g., tasks with missing objects by exploring the scene, suggesting alternatives, or providing a partial plan. The affordance-based scene representation combines object detection with an automatically generated object-affordance-mapping using ChatGPT. The core planning tool extends existing work by automatically correcting semantic and syntactic errors.

Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts.

SportsMetrics: Blending Text and Numerical Data to Understand Information Fusion in LLMs,"Yebowen Hu, Kaiqiang Song, Sangwoo Cho, Xiaoyang Wang, Hassan Foroosh, Dong Yu, Fei Liu",2024-02-15,"Large language models hold significant potential for integrating various data types, such as text documents and database records, for advanced analytics. However, blending text and numerical data presents substantial challenges. LLMs need to process and cross-reference entities and numbers, handle data inconsistencies and redundancies, and develop planning capabilities such as building a working memory for managing complex data queries. In this paper, we introduce four novel tasks centered around sports data analytics to evaluate the numerical reasoning and information fusion capabilities of LLMs. These tasks involve providing LLMs with detailed, play-by-play sports game descriptions, then challenging them with adversarial scenarios such as new game rules, longer durations, scrambled narratives, and analyzing key statistics in game summaries.

In this paper, we explore the integration of large language models (LLMs) into the video editing workflow to reduce these barriers. Our design vision is embodied in LAVE, a novel system that provides LLM-powered agent assistance and language-augmented editing features. LAVE automatically generates language descriptions for the user's footage, serving as the foundation for enabling the LLM to process videos and assist in editing tasks. When the user provides editing objectives, the agent plans and executes relevant actions to fulfill them. Moreover, LAVE allows users to edit videos through either the agent or direct UI manipulation, providing flexibility and enabling manual refinement of agent actions. Our user study, which included eight participants ranging from novices to proficient editors, demonstrated LAVE's effectiveness. The results also shed light on user perceptions of the proposed LLM-assisted editing paradigm and its impact on users' creativity and sense of co-creation.

SwissNYF: Tool Grounded LLM Agents for Black Box Setting,"Somnath Sendhil Kumar, Dhruv Jain, Eshaan Agarwal, Raunak Pandey",2024-02-15,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced capabilities in function-calling, these advancements primarily rely on accessing the functions' responses. This methodology is practical for simpler APIs but faces scalability issues with irreversible APIs that significantly impact the system, such as a database deletion API. Similarly, processes requiring extensive time for each API call and those necessitating forward planning, like automated action pipelines, present complex challenges. Furthermore, scenarios often arise where a generalized approach is needed because algorithms lack direct access to the specific implementations of these functions or secrets to use them. Traditional tool planning methods are inadequate in these cases, compelling the need to operate within black-box environments. Unlike their performance in tool manipulation, LLMs excel in black-box tasks, such as program synthesis. Therefore, we harness the program synthesis capabilities of LLMs to strategize tool usage in black-box settings, ensuring solutions are verified prior to implementation. We introduce TOPGUN, an ingeniously crafted approach leveraging program synthesis for black box tool planning.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which can create novel and realistic data or content, such as text, image, video, or code, based on some input or prior knowledge, offers innovative and disruptive solutions to address these challenges. However, there is a gap in the literature on the current state, opportunities, and challenges of generative AI in the construction industry. This study aims to fill this gap by providing a state-of-the-art analysis of generative AI in construction, with three objectives: (1) to review and categorize the existing and emerging generative AI opportunities and challenges in the construction industry; (2) to propose a framework for construction firms to build customized generative AI solutions using their own data, comprising steps such as data collection, dataset curation, training custom large language model (LLM), model evaluation, and deployment; and (3) to demonstrate the framework via a case study of developing a generative model for querying contract documents. The results show that retrieval augmented generation (RAG) improves the baseline LLM by 5.2, 9.4, and 4.8% in terms of quality, relevance, and reproducibility.

Chain-of-Planned-Behaviour Workflow Elicits Few-Shot Mobility Generation in LLMs,"Chenyang Shao, Fengli Xu, Bingbing Fan, Jingtao Ding, Yuan Yuan, Meng Wang, Yong Li",2024-02-15,"The powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have brought revolutionary changes to many fields, but their performance in human behaviour generation has not yet been extensively explored. This gap likely emerges because the internal processes governing behavioral intentions cannot be solely explained by abstract reasoning. Instead, they are also influenced by a multitude of factors, including social norms and personal preference. Inspired by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), we develop a LLM workflow named Chain-of-Planned Behaviour (CoPB) for mobility behaviour generation, which reflects the important spatio-temporal dynamics of human activities. Through exploiting the cognitive structures of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behaviour control in TPB, CoPB significantly enhance the ability of LLMs to reason the intention of next movement. Specifically, CoPB substantially reduces the error rate of mobility intention generation from 57.8% to 19.4%. To improve the scalability of the proposed CoPB workflow, we further explore the synergy between LLMs and mechanistic models. We find mechanistic mobility models, such as gravity model, can effectively map mobility intentions to physical mobility behaviours. The strategy of integrating CoPB with gravity model can reduce the token cost by 97.7% and achieve better performance simultaneously. Besides, the proposed CoPB workflow can facilitate GPT-4-turbo to automatically generate high quality labels for mobility behavior reasoning. We show such labels can be leveraged to fine-tune the smaller-scale, open source LLaMA 3-8B, which significantly reduces usage costs without sacrificing the quality of the generated behaviours.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09836v2
HGOT: Hierarchical Graph of Thoughts for Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning in Factuality Evaluation,"Yihao Fang, Stephen W. Thomas, Xiaodan Zhu",2024-02-14,"With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in numerous applications, the challenge of factuality and the propensity for hallucinations has emerged as a significant concern. To address this issue, particularly in retrieval-augmented in-context learning, we introduce the hierarchical graph of thoughts (HGOT), a structured, multi-layered graph approach designed to enhance the retrieval of pertinent passages during in-context learning. The framework utilizes the emergent planning capabilities of LLMs, employing the divide-and-conquer strategy to break down complex queries into manageable sub-queries. It refines self-consistency majority voting for answer selection, which incorporates the recently proposed citation recall and precision metrics to assess the quality of thoughts, linking an answer's credibility intrinsically to the thought's quality. This methodology introduces a weighted system in majority voting, prioritizing answers based on the citation quality of their thoughts. Additionally, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating retrieved passages, considering factors such as citation frequency and quality, self-consistency confidence, and the retrieval module's ranking. Experiments indicate that HGOT excels as a versatile approach, outperforming competing models in FEVER by up to $7\%$ and matching leading models such as Retrieve-then-Read in Open-SQuAD, and DSP in HotPotQA, demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing LLMs' factuality.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09390v2

On the Self-Verification Limitations of Large Language Models on Reasoning and Planning Tasks,"Kaya Stechly, Karthik Valmeekam, Subbarao Kambhampati",2024-02-12,"There has been considerable divergence of opinion on the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While the initial optimism that reasoning might emerge automatically with scale has been tempered thanks to a slew of counterexamples--ranging from multiplication to simple planning--there persists a wide spread belief that LLMs can self-critique and improve their own solutions in an iterative fashion. This belief seemingly rests on the assumption that verification of correctness should be easier than generation--a rather classical argument from computational complexity--which should be irrelevant to LLMs to the extent that what they are doing is approximate retrieval. In this paper, we set out to systematically investigate the effectiveness of iterative prompting in the context of reasoning and planning. We present a principled empirical study of the performance of GPT-4 in three domains: Game of 24, Graph Coloring, and STRIPS planning. We experiment both with the model critiquing its own answers and with an external correct reasoner verifying proposed solutions. In each case, we analyze whether the content of criticisms actually affects bottom line performance, and whether we can ablate elements of the augmented system without losing performance. We observe significant performance collapse with self-critique, significant performance gains with sound external verification, but that the content of critique doesn't matter to the performance of the system. In fact, merely re-prompting with a sound verifier maintains most of the benefits of more involved setups.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08115v1

To address these gaps, we first compile a suite of standardized evaluations spanning visual question answering, object localization, and challenge sets that probe properties such as hallucination; evaluations that provide fine-grained insight VLM capabilities. Second, we rigorously investigate VLMs along key design axes, including pretrained visual representations and training from base vs. instruct-tuned language models, amongst others.

Dose-volume histogram (DVH) prediction plays a critical role in automating this process. The geometric relationship between DVHs in radiotherapy plans and organs-at-risk (OAR) and planning target volume (PTV) has been well established. This study explores the potential of deep learning models for predicting DVHs using images and subsequent human intervention facilitated by a large-language model (LLM) to enhance the planning quality. We propose a pipeline to convert unstructured images to a structured graph consisting of image-patch nodes and dose nodes. A novel Dose Graph Neural Network (DoseGNN) model is developed for predicting DVHs from the structured graph. The proposed DoseGNN is enhanced with the LLM to encode massive knowledge from prescriptions and interactive instructions from clinicians. In this study, we introduced an online human-AI collaboration (OHAC) system as a practical implementation of the concept proposed for the automation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning. In comparison to the widely-employed DL models used in radiotherapy, DoseGNN achieved mean square errors that were 80$\%$, 76$\%$ and 41.0$\%$ of those predicted by Swin U-Net Transformer, 3D U-Net CNN and vanilla MLP, respectively.

Understanding the Weakness of Large Language Model Agents within a Complex Android Environment,"Mingzhe Xing, Rongkai Zhang, Hui Xue, Qi Chen, Fan Yang, Zhen Xiao",2024-02-09,"Large language models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent agents to execute intricate tasks within domain-specific software such as browsers and games. However, when applied to general-purpose software systems like operating systems, LLM agents face three primary challenges. Firstly, the action space is vast and dynamic, posing difficulties for LLM agents to maintain an up-to-date understanding and deliver accurate responses. Secondly, real-world tasks often require inter-application cooperation}, demanding farsighted planning from LLM agents. Thirdly, agents need to identify optimal solutions aligning with user constraints, such as security concerns and preferences. These challenges motivate AndroidArena, an environment and benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on a modern operating system. To address high-cost of manpower, we design a scalable and semi-automated method to construct the benchmark. In the task evaluation, AndroidArena incorporates accurate and adaptive metrics to address the issue of non-unique solutions. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art LLM agents struggle in cross-APP scenarios and adhering to specific constraints. Additionally, we identify a lack of four key capabilities, i.e., understanding, reasoning, exploration, and reflection, as primary reasons for the failure of LLM agents. Furthermore, we provide empirical analysis on the failure of reflection, and improve the success rate by 27% with our proposed exploration strategy. This work is the first to present valuable insights in understanding fine-grained weakness of LLM agents, and offers a path forward for future research in this area.

To address this issue, LLMs must identify such uncertainty and proactively seek clarification. This paper explores the concept of introspective planning as a systematic method for guiding LLMs in forming uncertainty--aware plans for robotic task execution without the need for fine-tuning. We investigate uncertainty quantification in task-level robot planning and demonstrate that introspection significantly improves both success rates and safety compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planning approaches.

The RL/LLM Taxonomy Tree: Reviewing Synergies Between Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models,"Moschoula Pternea, Prerna Singh, Abir Chakraborty, Yagna Oruganti, Mirco Milletari, Sayli Bapat, Kebei Jiang",2024-02-02,"In this work, we review research studies that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Language Models (LLMs), two areas that owe their momentum to the development of deep neural networks. We propose a novel taxonomy of three main classes based on the way that the two model types interact with each other. The first class, RL4LLM, includes studies where RL is leveraged to improve the performance of LLMs on tasks related to Natural Language Processing. L4LLM is divided into two sub-categories depending on whether RL is used to directly fine-tune an existing LLM or to improve the prompt of the LLM. In the second class, LLM4RL, an LLM assists the training of an RL model that performs a task that is not inherently related to natural language. We further break down LLM4RL based on the component of the RL training framework that the LLM assists or replaces, namely reward shaping, goal generation, and policy function. Finally, in the third class, RL+LLM, an LLM and an RL agent are embedded in a common planning framework without either of them contributing to training or fine-tuning of the other. We further branch this class to distinguish between studies with and without natural language feedback. We use this taxonomy to explore the motivations behind the synergy of LLMs and RL and explain the reasons for its success, while pinpointing potential shortcomings and areas where further research is needed, as well as alternative methodologies that serve the same goal.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01874v1
TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Real-World Planning with Language Agents,"Jian Xie, Kai Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Tinghui Zhu, Renze Lou, Yuandong Tian, Yanghua Xiao, Yu Su",2024-02-02,"Planning has been part of the core pursuit for artificial intelligence since its conception, but earlier AI agents mostly focused on constrained settings because many of the cognitive substrates necessary for human-level planning have been lacking. Recently, language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown interesting capabilities such as tool use and reasoning. Are these language agents capable of planning in more complex settings that are out of the reach of prior AI agents? To advance this investigation, we propose TravelPlanner, a new planning benchmark that focuses on travel planning, a common real-world planning scenario. It provides a rich sandbox environment, various tools for accessing nearly four million data records, and 1,225 meticulously curated planning intents and reference plans. Comprehensive evaluations show that the current language agents are not yet capable of handling such complex planning tasks-even GPT-4 only achieves a success rate of 0.6%. Language agents struggle to stay on task, use the right tools to collect information, or keep track of multiple constraints. However, we note that the mere possibility for language agents to tackle such a complex problem is in itself non-trivial progress. TravelPlanner provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future language agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01622v3
"LLMs Can't Plan, But Can Help Planning in LLM-Modulo Frameworks","Subbarao Kambhampati, Karthik Valmeekam, Lin Guan, Mudit Verma, Kaya Stechly, Siddhant Bhambri, Lucas Saldyt, Anil Murthy",2024-02-02,"There is considerable confusion about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in planning and reasoning tasks. On one side are over-optimistic claims that LLMs can indeed do these tasks with just the right prompting or self-verification strategies. On the other side are perhaps over-pessimistic claims that all that LLMs are good for in planning/reasoning tasks are as mere translators of the problem specification from one syntactic format to another, and ship the problem off to external symbolic solvers. In this position paper, we take the view that both these extremes are misguided. We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons for misunderstandings in the literature. We will also argue that LLMs should be viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much more meaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple front-end/back-end format translators. We present a vision of {\bf LLM-Modulo Frameworks} that combine the strengths of LLMs with external model-based verifiers in a tighter bi-directional interaction regime. We will show how the models driving the external verifiers themselves can be acquired with the help of LLMs. We will also argue that rather than simply pipelining LLMs and symbolic components, this LLM-Modulo Framework provides a better neuro-symbolic approach that offers tighter integration between LLMs and symbolic components, and allows extending the scope of model-based planning/reasoning regimes towards more flexible knowledge, problem and preference specifications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01817v3
Plan-Grounded Large Language Models for Dual Goal Conversational Settings,"Diogo Glória-Silva, Rafael Ferreira, Diogo Tavares, David Semedo, João Magalhães",2024-02-01,"Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow user instructions has been shown to supply the LLM with ample capacity to converse fluently while being aligned with humans. Yet, it is not completely clear how an LLM can lead a plan-grounded conversation in mixed-initiative settings where instructions flow in both directions of the conversation, i.e. both the LLM and the user provide instructions to one another. In this paper, we tackle a dual goal mixed-initiative conversational setting where the LLM not only grounds the conversation on an arbitrary plan but also seeks to satisfy both a procedural plan and user instructions. The LLM is then responsible for guiding the user through the plan and, at the same time, adapting to new circumstances, answering questions, and activating safety guardrails when needed. We propose a novel LLM that grounds the dialogue on a procedural plan, can take the dialogue initiative, and enforces guardrails on the system's behavior, while also improving the LLM's responses to unexpected user behavior. Experiments in controlled settings and with real users show that the best-performing model, which we call PlanLLM, achieves a 2.1x improvement over a strong baseline. Moreover, experiments also show good generalization to unseen domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01053v1

Goecks, Nicholas Waytowich",2024-02-01,"The development of Courses of Action (COAs) in military operations is traditionally a time-consuming and intricate process. Addressing this challenge, this study introduces COA-GPT, a novel algorithm employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid and efficient generation of valid COAs. COA-GPT incorporates military doctrine and domain expertise to LLMs through in-context learning, allowing commanders to input mission information - in both text and image formats - and receive strategically aligned COAs for review and approval. Uniquely, COA-GPT not only accelerates COA development, producing initial COAs within seconds, but also facilitates real-time refinement based on commander feedback. This work evaluates COA-GPT in a military-relevant scenario within a militarized version of the StarCraft II game, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. Our results demonstrate COA-GPT's superiority in generating strategically sound COAs more swiftly, with added benefits of enhanced adaptability and alignment with commander intentions.

Formal-LLM: Integrating Formal Language and Natural Language for Controllable LLM-based Agents,"Zelong Li, Wenyue Hua, Hao Wang, He Zhu, Yongfeng Zhang",2024-02-01,"Recent advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) enable AI Agents to automatically generate and execute multi-step plans to solve complex tasks. However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel ``Formal-LLM'' framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows human users to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

Learning Planning-based Reasoning by Trajectories Collection and Process Reward Synthesizing,"Fangkai Jiao, Chengwei Qin, Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F. Chen, Shafiq Joty",2024-02-01,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00658v2
Efficient Non-Parametric Uncertainty Quantification for Black-Box Large Language Models and Decision Planning,"Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai, Walter Talbott, Jian Zhang",2024-02-01,"Step-by-step decision planning with large language models (LLMs) is gaining attention in AI agent development. This paper focuses on decision planning with uncertainty estimation to address the hallucination problem in language models. Existing approaches are either white-box or computationally demanding, limiting use of black-box proprietary LLMs within budgets. The paper's first contribution is a non-parametric uncertainty quantification method for LLMs, efficiently estimating point-wise dependencies between input-decision on the fly with a single inference, without access to token logits. This estimator informs the statistical interpretation of decision trustworthiness. The second contribution outlines a systematic design for a decision-making agent, generating actions like ``turn on the bathroom light'' based on user prompts such as ``take a bath''. Users will be asked to provide preferences when more than one action has high estimated point-wise dependencies. In conclusion, our uncertainty estimation and decision-making agent design offer a cost-efficient approach for AI agent development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00251v1
Do Language Models Exhibit the Same Cognitive Biases in Problem Solving as Human Learners?,"Andreas Opedal, Alessandro Stolfo, Haruki Shirakami, Ying Jiao, Ryan Cotterell, Bernhard Schölkopf, Abulhair Saparov, Mrinmaya Sachan",2024-01-31,"There is increasing interest in employing large language models (LLMs) as cognitive models. For such purposes, it is central to understand which properties of human cognition are well-modeled by LLMs, and which are not. In this work, we study the biases of LLMs in relation to those known in children when solving arithmetic word problems. Surveying the learning science literature, we posit that the problem-solving process can be split into three distinct steps: text comprehension, solution planning and solution execution. We construct tests for each one in order to understand whether current LLMs display the same cognitive biases as children in these steps. We generate a novel set of word problems for each of these tests, using a neuro-symbolic approach that enables fine-grained control over the problem features. We find evidence that LLMs, with and without instruction-tuning, exhibit human-like biases in both the text-comprehension and the solution-planning steps of the solving process, but not in the final step, in which the arithmetic expressions are executed to obtain the answer.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18070v2
Paramanu: A Family of Novel Efficient Indic Generative Foundation Language Models,"Mitodru Niyogi, Arnab Bhattacharya",2024-01-31,"We present Gyan AI Paramanu (""atom""), a family of novel language models for Indian languages. It is a collection of auto-regressive monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual Indic language models pretrained from scratch on a single GPU for 10 Indian languages (Assamese, Bangla, Hindi, Konkani, Maithili, Marathi, Odia, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu) across 5 scripts (Bangla, Devanagari, Odia, Tamil, Telugu) of varying sizes ranging from 13.29M to 367.5M.The models are pretrained with a context size of 1024 on a single GPU. The models are very efficient, small, fast, and powerful. We have also developed an efficient most advanced Indic tokenizer that can even tokenize unseen languages. In order to avoid the ""curse of multi-linguality"" in our multilingual mParamanu model, we pretrained on comparable corpora by typological grouping using the same script. We performed human evaluation of our pretrained models for open end text generation on grammar, coherence, creativity, and factuality metrics for Bangla, Hindi, and Sanskrit. Our Bangla, Hindi, and Sanskrit models outperformed GPT-3.5-Turbo (ChatGPT), Bloom 7B, LLaMa-2 7B, OPT 6.7B, GPT-J 6B, GPTNeo 1.3B, GPT2-XL large language models (LLMs) by a large margin despite being smaller in size by 66 to 20 times compared to standard 7B LLMs. To run inference on our pretrained models, CPU is enough, and GPU is not needed.

Leveraging Professional Radiologists' Expertise to Enhance LLMs' Evaluation for Radiology Reports,"Qingqing Zhu, Xiuying Chen, Qiao Jin, Benjamin Hou, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Pritam Mukherjee, Xin Gao, Ronald M Summers, Zhiyong Lu",2024-01-29,"In radiology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced report generation, but automatic evaluation of these AI-produced reports remains challenging. Current metrics, such as Conventional Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Clinical Efficacy (CE), often fall short in capturing the semantic intricacies of clinical contexts or overemphasize clinical details, undermining report clarity. To overcome these issues, our proposed method synergizes the expertise of professional radiologists with Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 1. Utilizing In-Context Instruction Learning (ICIL) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, our approach aligns LLM evaluations with radiologist standards, enabling detailed comparisons between human and AI generated reports. This is further enhanced by a Regression model that aggregates sentence evaluation scores. Experimental results show that our ""Detailed GPT-4 (5-shot)"" model achieves a 0.48 score, outperforming the METEOR metric by 0.19, while our ""Regressed GPT-4"" model shows even greater alignment with expert evaluations, exceeding the best existing metric by a 0.35 margin. Moreover, the robustness of our explanations has been validated through a thorough iterative strategy. We plan to publicly release annotations from radiology experts, setting a new standard for accuracy in future assessments.

As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges.

The paper outlines high-level requirements for measurement: identifying the necessary expertise to implement this approach and illustrating it through a case study. Our work highlights the unique vulnerabilities of large language models to perpetrating representational harms, particularly when these harms go unmeasured and unmitigated.

Large language model empowered participatory urban planning,"Zhilun Zhou, Yuming Lin, Yong Li",2024-01-24,"Participatory urban planning is the mainstream of modern urban planning and involves the active engagement of different stakeholders. However, the traditional participatory paradigm encounters challenges in time and manpower, while the generative planning tools fail to provide adjustable and inclusive solutions. This research introduces an innovative urban planning approach integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) within the participatory process. The framework, based on the crafted LLM agent, consists of role-play, collaborative generation, and feedback iteration, solving a community-level land-use task catering to 1000 distinct interests. Empirical experiments in diverse urban communities exhibit LLM's adaptability and effectiveness across varied planning scenarios. The results were evaluated on four metrics, surpassing human experts in satisfaction and inclusion, and rivaling state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods in service and ecology. Further analysis shows the advantage of LLM agents in providing adjustable and inclusive solutions with natural language reasoning and strong scalability.

However, the personalization issue still remains a much-coveted property, especially when it comes to the multiple sources involved in the dialogue system. To better plan and incorporate the use of multiple sources in generating personalized response, we firstly decompose it into three sub-tasks: Knowledge Source Selection, Knowledge Retrieval, and Response Generation. We then propose a novel Unified Multi-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation system (UniMS-RAG) Specifically, we unify these three sub-tasks with different formulations into the same sequence-to-sequence paradigm during the training, to adaptively retrieve evidences and evaluate the relevance on-demand using special tokens, called acting tokens and evaluation tokens. Enabling language models to generate acting tokens facilitates interaction with various knowledge sources, allowing them to adapt their behavior to diverse task requirements. Meanwhile, evaluation tokens gauge the relevance score between the dialogue context and the retrieved evidence. In addition, we carefully design a self-refinement mechanism to iteratively refine the generated response considering 1) the consistency scores between the generated response and retrieved evidence; and 2) the relevance scores. Experiments on two personalized datasets (DuLeMon and KBP) show that UniMS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the knowledge source selection and response generation task with itself as a retriever in a unified manner.

LLM-based policy generation for intent-based management of applications,"Kristina Dzeparoska, Jieyu Lin, Ali Tizghadam, Alberto Leon-Garcia",2024-01-22,"Automated management requires decomposing high-level user requests, such as intents, to an abstraction that the system can understand and execute. This is challenging because even a simple intent requires performing a number of ordered steps. And the task of identifying and adapting these steps (as conditions change) requires a decomposition approach that cannot be exactly pre-defined beforehand. To tackle these challenges and support automated intent decomposition and execution, we explore the few-shot capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose a pipeline that progressively decomposes intents by generating the required actions using a policy-based abstraction. This allows us to automate the policy execution by creating a closed control loop for the intent deployment. To do so, we generate and map the policies to APIs and form application management loops that perform the necessary monitoring, analysis, planning and execution. We evaluate our proposal with a use-case to fulfill and assure an application service chain of virtual network functions.

However, complex medical concepts and jargon within clinical notes hinder patient comprehension and may lead to anxiety. We developed a patient-facing tool to make clinical notes more readable, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simplify, extract information from, and add context to notes. We prompt engineered GPT-4 to perform these augmentation tasks on real clinical notes donated by breast cancer survivors and synthetic notes generated by a clinician, a total of 12 notes with 3868 words. In June 2023, 200 female-identifying US-based participants were randomly assigned three clinical notes with varying levels of augmentations using our tool. Participants answered questions about each note, evaluating their understanding of follow-up actions and self-reported confidence. We found that augmentations were associated with a significant increase in action understanding score (0.63 $\pm$ 0.04 for select augmentations, compared to 0.54 $\pm$ 0.02 for the control) with p=0.002. In-depth interviews of self-identifying breast cancer patients (N=7) were also conducted via video conferencing. Augmentations, especially definitions, elicited positive responses among the seven participants, with some concerns about relying on LLMs. Augmentations were evaluated for errors by clinicians, and we found misleading errors occur, with errors more common in real donated notes than synthetic notes, illustrating the importance of carefully written clinical notes. Augmentations improve some but not all readability metrics. This work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to improve patients' experience with clinical notes at a lower burden to clinicians.

Different from short videos with a few seconds, vlog often contains a complex storyline with diversified scenes, which is challenging for most existing video generation approaches. To break through this bottleneck, our Vlogger smartly leverages Large Language Model (LLM) as Director and decomposes a long video generation task of vlog into four key stages, where we invoke various foundation models to play the critical roles of vlog professionals, including (1) Script, (2) Actor, (3) ShowMaker, and (4) Voicer. With such a design of mimicking human beings, our Vlogger can generate vlogs through explainable cooperation of top-down planning and bottom-up shooting. Moreover, we introduce a novel video diffusion model, ShowMaker, which serves as a videographer in our Vlogger for generating the video snippet of each shooting scene. By incorporating Script and Actor attentively as textual and visual prompts, it can effectively enhance spatial-temporal coherence in the snippet. Besides, we design a concise mixed training paradigm for ShowMaker, boosting its capacity for both T2V generation and prediction. Finally, the extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot T2V generation and prediction tasks. More importantly, Vlogger can generate over 5-minute vlogs from open-world descriptions, without loss of video coherence on script and actor.

This work studies to what extent Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate coding and algorithmic tasks to provide insights into general capabilities in such algorithmic reasoning tasks. We introduce benchmarks for straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the simulation capabilities of LLMs with sorting algorithms and nested loops and show that a routine's computational complexity directly affects an LLM's ability to simulate its execution. While the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong simulation capabilities, the process is fragile, seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition, and is affected by memorisation. We propose a novel off-the-shelf prompting method, Chain of Simulation (CoSm), which instructs LLMs to simulate code execution line by line/follow the computation pattern of compilers. CoSm efficiently helps LLMs reduce memorisation and shallow pattern recognition while improving simulation performance. We consider the success of CoSm in code simulation to be inspirational for other general routine simulation reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09074v4

Tenenbaum, Tianmin Shu",2024-01-16,"Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's mental states, is an essential ingredient for developing machines with human-level social intelligence. Recent machine learning models, particularly large language models, seem to show some aspects of ToM understanding. However, existing ToM benchmarks use unimodal datasets - either video or text. Human ToM, on the other hand, is more than video or text understanding. People can flexibly reason about another person's mind based on conceptual representations (e.g., goals, beliefs, plans) extracted from any available data. To address this, we introduce a multimodal Theory of Mind question answering (MMToM-QA) benchmark. MMToM-QA comprehensively evaluates machine ToM both on multimodal data and on different kinds of unimodal data about a person's activity in a household environment. To engineer multimodal ToM capacity, we propose a novel method, BIP-ALM (Bayesian Inverse Planning Accelerated by Language Models). BIP-ALM extracts unified representations from multimodal data and utilizes language models for scalable Bayesian inverse planning. We conducted a systematic comparison of human performance, BIP-ALM, and state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4. The experiments demonstrate that large language models and large multimodal models still lack robust ToM capacity. BIP-ALM, on the other hand, shows promising results, by leveraging the power of both model-based mental inference and language models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08743v2
Consolidating Trees of Robotic Plans Generated Using Large Language Models to Improve Reliability,"Md Sadman Sakib, Yu Sun",2024-01-15,"The inherent probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces an element of unpredictability, raising concerns about potential discrepancies in their output. This paper introduces an innovative approach aims to generate correct and optimal robotic task plans for diverse real-world demands and scenarios. LLMs have been used to generate task plans, but they are unreliable and may contain wrong, questionable, or high-cost steps. The proposed approach uses LLM to generate a number of task plans as trees and amalgamates them into a graph by removing questionable paths. Then an optimal task tree can be retrieved to circumvent questionable and high-cost nodes, thereby improving planning accuracy and execution efficiency. The approach is further improved by incorporating a large knowledge network. Leveraging GPT-4 further, the high-level task plan is converted into a low-level Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) plan executable by a robot.

Small LLMs Are Weak Tool Learners: A Multi-LLM Agent,"Weizhou Shen, Chenliang Li, Hongzhan Chen, Ming Yan, Xiaojun Quan, Hehong Chen, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang",2024-01-14,"Large Language Model (LLM) agents significantly extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs, empowering them to interact with external tools (e.g., APIs, functions) and complete various tasks in a self-directed fashion. The challenge of tool use demands that LLMs not only understand user queries and generate answers accurately but also excel in task planning, tool invocation, and result summarization. While traditional works focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer. Each component is implemented by a single LLM that focuses on a specific capability and collaborates with others to accomplish the task. This modular framework facilitates individual updates and the potential use of smaller LLMs for building each capability. To effectively train this framework, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. First, we fine-tune a backbone LLM on the entire dataset without discriminating sub-tasks, providing the model with a comprehensive understanding of the task. Second, the fine-tuned LLM is used to instantiate the planner, caller, and summarizer respectively, which are continually fine-tuned on respective sub-tasks. Evaluation across various tool-use benchmarks illustrates that our proposed multi-LLM framework surpasses the traditional single-LLM approach, highlighting its efficacy and advantages in tool learning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07324v3

First, we formulate an EHR question-answering task into a tool-use planning process, efficiently decomposing a complicated task into a sequence of manageable actions. By integrating interactive coding and execution feedback, EHRAgent learns from error messages and improves the originally generated code through iterations. Furthermore, we enhance the LLM agent by incorporating long-term memory, which allows EHRAgent to effectively select and build upon the most relevant successful cases from past experiences. Experiments on three real-world multi-tabular EHR datasets show that EHRAgent outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 29.6% in success rate.

To address this issue, we propose a human-friendly and flexible robotic system, ORGANA, that automates a diverse set of chemistry experiments. It is capable of interacting with chemists in the lab through natural language, using Large Language Models (LLMs).

However, possible anthropomorphization and leniency towards failure cases have propelled discussions on emergent abilities of Large Language Models especially on Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in Large Language Models. While several false-belief tests exists to verify the ability to infer and maintain mental models of another entity, we study a special application of ToM abilities that has higher stakes and possibly irreversible consequences : Human Robot Interaction. In this work, we explore the task of Perceived Behavior Recognition, where a robot employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the robot's generated behavior in a manner similar to human observer. We focus on four behavior types, namely - explicable, legible, predictable, and obfuscatory behavior which have been extensively used to synthesize interpretable robot behaviors. The LLMs goal is, therefore to be a human proxy to the agent, and to answer how a certain agent behavior would be perceived by the human in the loop, for example ""Given a robot's behavior X, would the human observer find it explicable?"". We conduct a human subject study to verify that the users are able to correctly answer such a question in the curated situations (robot setting and plan) across five domains. A first analysis of the belief test yields extremely positive results inflating ones expectations of LLMs possessing ToM abilities. We then propose and perform a suite of perturbation tests which breaks this illusion, i.e. Inconsistent Belief, Uninformative Context and Conviction Test. We conclude that, the high score of LLMs on vanilla prompts showcases its potential use in HRI settings, however to possess ToM demands invariance to trivial or irrelevant perturbations in the context which LLMs lack.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05302v2

This approach simplifies compilation of machine learning-ready datasets for various materials discovery applications, and significantly ease the accessibility of advanced natural language processing tools for novice users in natural language.

Resolving Crash Bugs via Large Language Models: An Empirical Study,"Xueying Du, Mingwei Liu, Juntao Li, Hanlin Wang, Xin Peng, Yiling Lou",2023-12-16,"Crash bugs cause unexpected program behaviors or even termination, requiring high-priority resolution. However, manually resolving crash bugs is challenging and labor-intensive, and researchers have proposed various techniques for their automated localization and repair. ChatGPT, a recent large language model (LLM), has garnered significant attention due to its exceptional performance across various domains. This work performs the first investigation into ChatGPT's capability in resolve real-world crash bugs, focusing on its effectiveness in both localizing and repairing code-related and environment-related crash bugs. Specifically, we initially assess ChatGPT's fundamental ability to resolve crash bugs with basic prompts in a single iteration. We observe that ChatGPT performs better at resolving code-related crash bugs compared to environment-related ones, and its primary challenge in resolution lies in inaccurate localization. Additionally, we explore ChatGPT's potential with various advanced prompts. Furthermore, by stimulating ChatGPT's self-planning, it methodically investigates each potential crash-causing environmental factor through proactive inquiry, ultimately identifying the root cause of the crash. Based on our findings, we propose IntDiagSolver, an interaction methodology designed to facilitate precise crash bug resolution through continuous interaction with LLMs. Evaluating IntDiagSolver on multiple LLMs reveals consistent enhancement in the accuracy of crash bug resolution, including ChatGPT, Claude, and CodeLlama.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10448v1
ProTIP: Progressive Tool Retrieval Improves Planning,"Raviteja Anantha, Bortik Bandyopadhyay, Anirudh Kashi, Sayantan Mahinder, Andrew W Hill, Srinivas Chappidi",2023-12-16,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex multi-step planning tasks, where the tool retrieval (TR) step is crucial for achieving successful outcomes. Two prevalent approaches for TR are single-step retrieval, which utilizes the complete query, and sequential retrieval using task decomposition (TD), where a full query is segmented into discrete atomic subtasks. While single-step retrieval lacks the flexibility to handle ""inter-tool dependency,"" the TD approach necessitates maintaining ""subtask-tool atomicity alignment,"" as the toolbox can evolve dynamically. To address these limitations, we introduce the Progressive Tool retrieval to Improve Planning (ProTIP) framework. ProTIP is a lightweight, contrastive learning-based framework that implicitly performs TD without the explicit requirement of subtask labels, while simultaneously maintaining subtask-tool atomicity. On the ToolBench dataset, ProTIP outperforms the ChatGPT task decomposition-based approach by a remarkable margin, achieving a 24% improvement in Recall@K=10 for TR and a 41% enhancement in tool accuracy for plan generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10332v1
LLMind: Orchestrating AI and IoT with LLM for Complex Task Execution,"Hongwei Cui, Yuyang Du, Qun Yang, Yulin Shao, Soung Chang Liew",2023-12-14,"The exploration of large language models (LLMs) for task planning and IoT automation has recently gained significant attention. However, existing works suffer from limitations in terms of resource accessibility, complex task planning, and efficiency. In this paper, we present LLMind, an LLM-based AI agent framework that enables effective collaboration among IoT devices for executing complex tasks. Inspired by the functional specialization theory of the brain, our framework integrates an LLM with domain-specific AI modules, enhancing its capabilities. Complex tasks, which may involve collaborations of multiple domain-specific AI modules and IoT devices, are executed through a control script generated by the LLM using a Language-Code transformation approach, which first converts language descriptions to an intermediate finite-state machine (FSM) before final precise transformation to code. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a novel experience accumulation mechanism to enhance response speed and effectiveness, allowing the framework to evolve and become progressively sophisticated through continuing user and machine interactions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09007v3

However, while these robots need a certain degree of autonomy to learn and explore, they also should respect various constraints, for access control and beyond. We explore the novel field of incorporating privacy, security, and access control constraints with robot task planning approaches. We report preliminary results on the classical symbolic approach, deep-learned neural networks, and modern ideas using large language models as knowledge base.

Learning adaptive planning representations with natural language guidance,"Lionel Wong, Jiayuan Mao, Pratyusha Sharma, Zachary S. Siegel, Jiahai Feng, Noa Korneev, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Jacob Andreas",2023-12-13,"Effective planning in the real world requires not only world knowledge, but the ability to leverage that knowledge to build the right representation of the task at hand. Decades of hierarchical planning techniques have used domain-specific temporal action abstractions to support efficient and accurate planning, almost always relying on human priors and domain knowledge to decompose hard tasks into smaller subproblems appropriate for a goal or set of goals. This paper describes Ada (Action Domain Acquisition), a framework for automatically constructing task-specific planning representations using task-general background knowledge from language models (LMs). Starting with a general-purpose hierarchical planner and a low-level goal-conditioned policy, Ada interactively learns a library of planner-compatible high-level action abstractions and low-level controllers adapted to a particular domain of planning tasks.

However, there is no research tackling how AI examines nature. This case study presents a pioneering exploration into the AI attitudes (ecocentric, anthropocentric and antipathetic) toward nature. Experiments with a Large Language Model (LLM) and an image captioning algorithm demonstrate the presence of anthropocentric biases in AI. Moreover, to delve deeper into these biases and Human-Nature-AI interaction, we conducted a real-life experiment in which participants underwent an immersive de-anthropocentric experience in a forest and subsequently engaged with ChatGPT to co-create narratives. By creating fictional AI chatbot characters with ecocentric attributes, emotions and views, we successfully amplified ecocentric exchanges. We encountered some difficulties, mainly that participants deviated from narrative co-creation to short dialogues and questions and answers, possibly due to the novelty of interacting with LLMs. To solve this problem, we recommend providing preliminary guidelines on interacting with LLMs and allowing participants to get familiar with the technology. We plan to repeat this experiment in various countries and forests to expand our corpus of ecocentric materials.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11525v1
Large Language Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Systems for 6G Communications,"Feibo Jiang, Li Dong, Yubo Peng, Kezhi Wang, Kun Yang, Cunhua Pan, Dusit Niyato, Octavia A. Dobre",2023-12-13,"The rapid development of the Large Language Model (LLM) presents huge opportunities for 6G communications, e.g., network optimization and management by allowing users to input task requirements to LLMs by nature language. However, directly applying native LLMs in 6G encounters various challenges, such as a lack of private communication data and knowledge, limited logical reasoning, evaluation, and refinement abilities. Integrating LLMs with the capabilities of retrieval, planning, memory, evaluation and reflection in agents can greatly enhance the potential of LLMs for 6G communications. To this end, we propose a multi-agent system with customized communication knowledge and tools for solving communication related tasks using natural language, comprising three components: (1) Multi-agent Data Retrieval (MDR), which employs the condensate and inference agents to refine and summarize communication knowledge from the knowledge base, expanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs in 6G communications; (2) Multi-agent Collaborative Planning (MCP), which utilizes multiple planning agents to generate feasible solutions for the communication related task from different perspectives based on the retrieved knowledge; (3) Multi-agent Evaluation and Reflecxion (MER), which utilizes the evaluation agent to assess the solutions, and applies the reflexion agent and refinement agent to provide improvement suggestions for current solutions.

Sequential Planning in Large Partially Observable Environments guided by LLMs,Swarna Kamal Paul,2023-12-12,"Sequential planning in large state space and action space quickly becomes intractable due to combinatorial explosion of the search space. Heuristic methods, like monte-carlo tree search, though effective for large state space, but struggle if action space is large. Pure reinforcement learning methods, relying only on reward signals, needs prohibitively large interactions with the environment to device a viable plan. If the state space, observations and actions can be represented in natural language then Large Language models (LLM) can be used to generate action plans. Recently several such goal-directed agents like Reflexion, CLIN, SayCan were able to surpass the performance of other state-of-the-art methods with minimum or no task specific training. But they still struggle with exploration and get stuck in local optima. Their planning capabilities are limited by the limited reasoning capability of the foundational LLMs on text data. We propose a hybrid agent ""neoplanner"", that synergizes both state space search with queries to foundational LLM to get the best action plan. The reward signals are quantitatively used to drive the search. A balance of exploration and exploitation is maintained by maximizing upper confidence bounds of values of states. In places where random exploration is needed, the LLM is queried to generate an action plan. Learnings from each trial are stored as entity relationships in text format. Those are used in future queries to the LLM for continual improvement. Experiments in the Scienceworld environment reveals a 124% improvement from the current best method in terms of average reward gained across multiple tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07368v1
Building Open-Ended Embodied Agent via Language-Policy Bidirectional Adaptation,"Shaopeng Zhai, Jie Wang, Tianyi Zhang, Fuxian Huang, Qi Zhang, Ming Zhou, Jing Hou, Yu Qiao, Yu Liu",2023-12-12,"Building embodied agents on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have revolutionized human-AI interaction: researchers can now leverage language instructions to plan decision-making for open-ended tasks. However, existing research faces challenges in meeting the requirement of open-endedness. They typically either train LLM/RL models to adapt to a fixed counterpart, limiting exploration of novel skills and hindering the efficacy of human-AI interaction. To this end, we present OpenPAL, a co-training framework comprising two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM to translate human instructions into goals for planning, and goal-conditioned training a policy for decision-making; (2) co-training to align the LLM and policy, achieving instruction open-endedness. We conducted experiments using Contra, an open-ended FPS game, demonstrating that an agent trained with OpenPAL not only comprehends arbitrary instructions but also exhibits efficient execution.

LLF-Bench: Benchmark for Interactive Learning from Language Feedback,"Ching-An Cheng, Andrey Kolobov, Dipendra Misra, Allen Nie, Adith Swaminathan",2023-12-11,"We introduce a new benchmark, LLF-Bench (Learning from Language Feedback Benchmark; pronounced as ""elf-bench""), to evaluate the ability of AI agents to interactively learn from natural language feedback and instructions. Learning from language feedback (LLF) is essential for people, largely because the rich information this feedback provides can help a learner avoid much of trial and error and thereby speed up the learning process. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled AI agents to comprehend natural language -- and hence AI agents can potentially benefit from language feedback during learning like humans do. But existing interactive benchmarks do not assess this crucial capability: they either use numeric reward feedback or require no learning at all (only planning or information retrieval). LLF-Bench is designed to fill this omission. LLF-Bench is a diverse collection of sequential decision-making tasks that includes user recommendation, poem writing, navigation, and robot control. The objective of an agent is to interactively solve these tasks based on their natural-language instructions and the feedback received after taking actions. Crucially, to ensure that the agent actually ""learns"" from the feedback, LLF-Bench implements several randomization techniques (such as paraphrasing and environment randomization) to ensure that the task isn't familiar to the agent and that the agent is robust to various verbalizations. In addition, LLF-Bench provides a unified OpenAI Gym interface for all its tasks and allows the users to easily configure the information the feedback conveys (among suggestion, explanation, and instantaneous performance) to study how agents respond to different types of feedback. Together, these features make LLF-Bench a unique research platform for developing and testing LLF agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06853v2
Context Tuning for Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Raviteja Anantha, Tharun Bethi, Danil Vodianik, Srinivas Chappidi",2023-12-09,"Large language models (LLMs) have the remarkable ability to solve new tasks with just a few examples, but they need access to the right tools. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this problem by retrieving a list of relevant tools for a given task. However, RAG's tool retrieval step requires all the required information to be explicitly present in the query. This is a limitation, as semantic search, the widely adopted tool retrieval method, can fail when the query is incomplete or lacks context. To address this limitation, we propose Context Tuning for RAG, which employs a smart context retrieval system to fetch relevant information that improves both tool retrieval and plan generation. Our lightweight context retrieval model uses numerical, categorical, and habitual usage signals to retrieve and rank context items. Our empirical results demonstrate that context tuning significantly enhances semantic search, achieving a 3.5-fold and 1.5-fold improvement in Recall@K for context retrieval and tool retrieval tasks respectively, and resulting in an 11.6% increase in LLM-based planner accuracy. Additionally, we show that our proposed lightweight model using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) with LambdaMART outperforms GPT-4 based retrieval. Moreover, we observe context augmentation at plan generation, even after tool retrieval, reduces hallucination.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05708v1

In particular, we propose that world and agent models are a better abstraction of reasoning, that introduces the crucial elements of deliberate human-like reasoning, including beliefs about the world and other agents, anticipation of consequences, goals/rewards, and strategic planning. Crucially, language models in LAW serve as a backend to implement the system or its elements and hence provide the computational power and adaptability.

Despite not having the capacity to process and memorize vast amounts of information in their brains, humans excel in critical thinking, planning, reflection, and harnessing available tools to interact with and interpret the world, enabling them to find answers efficiently. The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest that machines might also possess the aforementioned human-like capabilities, allowing them to exhibit powerful abilities even with a constrained parameter count. In this paper, we introduce KwaiAgents, a generalized information-seeking agent system based on LLMs. Within KwaiAgents, we propose an agent system that employs LLMs as its cognitive core, which is capable of understanding a user's query, behavior guidelines, and referencing external documents. The agent can also update and retrieve information from its internal memory, plan and execute actions using a time-aware search-browse toolkit, and ultimately provide a comprehensive response. We further investigate the system's performance when powered by LLMs less advanced than GPT-4, and introduce the Meta-Agent Tuning (MAT) framework, designed to ensure even an open-sourced 7B or 13B model performs well among many agent systems.

In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation framework complemented by a baseline dataset, meticulously crafted for this study. This dataset is structured around three key tasks: plotting spatial points, planning routes in two-dimensional (2D) spaces, and devising pathways in three-dimensional (3D) environments.

Creative Agents: Empowering Agents with Imagination for Creative Tasks,"Chi Zhang, Penglin Cai, Yuhui Fu, Haoqi Yuan, Zongqing Lu",2023-12-05,"We study building embodied agents for open-ended creative tasks. While existing methods build instruction-following agents that can perform diverse open-ended tasks, none of them demonstrates creativity -- the ability to give novel and diverse task solutions implicit in the language instructions. This limitation comes from their inability to convert abstract language instructions into concrete task goals in the environment and perform long-horizon planning for such complicated goals. Given the observation that humans perform creative tasks with the help of imagination, we propose a class of solutions for creative agents, where the controller is enhanced with an imaginator that generates detailed imaginations of task outcomes conditioned on language instructions. We introduce several approaches to implementing the components of creative agents. We implement the imaginator with either a large language model for textual imagination or a diffusion model for visual imagination. The controller can either be a behavior-cloning policy learned from data or a pre-trained foundation model generating executable codes in the environment. We benchmark creative tasks with the challenging open-world game Minecraft, where the agents are asked to create diverse buildings given free-form language instructions. In addition, we propose novel evaluation metrics for open-ended creative tasks utilizing GPT-4V, which holds many advantages over existing metrics. We perform a detailed experimental analysis of creative agents, showing that creative agents are the first AI agents accomplishing diverse building creation in the survival mode of Minecraft.

LLM A*: Human in the Loop Large Language Models Enabled A* Search for Robotics,"Hengjia Xiao, Peng Wang",2023-12-04,"This research focuses on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help with (path) planning for mobile embodied agents such as robots, in a human-in-the-loop and interactive manner. A novel framework named LLM A*, aims to leverage the commonsense of LLMs, and the utility-optimal A* is proposed to facilitate few-shot near-optimal path planning. Prompts are used for two main purposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments, costs, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate planning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and renders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to humans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the accessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to communities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL demonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space and achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL. The interactive nature of LLM A* also makes it a promising tool for deployment in collaborative human-robot tasks.

To this end, we introduce Robotic Vision-Language Planning (ViLa), a novel approach for long-horizon robotic planning that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate a sequence of actionable steps. ViLa directly integrates perceptual data into its reasoning and planning process, enabling a profound understanding of commonsense knowledge in the visual world, including spatial layouts and object attributes.

Exploring Large Language Models for Human Mobility Prediction under Public Events,"Yuebing Liang, Yichao Liu, Xiaohan Wang, Zhan Zhao",2023-11-29,"Public events, such as concerts and sports games, can be major attractors for large crowds, leading to irregular surges in travel demand. Accurate human mobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as well as traffic or crowd management. While rich textual descriptions about public events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to encode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing methods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling data sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public events (LLM-MPE) based on Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their unprecedented ability to process textual data, learn from minimal examples, and generate human-readable explanations. Specifically, LLM-MPE first transforms raw, unstructured event descriptions from online sources into a standardized format, and then segments historical mobility data into regular and event-related components. A prompting strategy is designed to direct LLMs in making and rationalizing demand predictions considering historical mobility and event features. A case study is conducted for Barclays Center in New York City, based on publicly available event information and taxi trip data. Results show that LLM-MPE surpasses traditional models, particularly on event days, with textual data significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, LLM-MPE offers interpretable insights into its predictions. Despite the great potential of LLMs, we also identify key challenges including misinformation and high costs that remain barriers to their broader adoption in large-scale human mobility analysis.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17351v1

RoboGPT: an intelligent agent of making embodied long-term decisions for daily instruction tasks,"Yaran Chen, Wenbo Cui, Yuanwen Chen, Mining Tan, Xinyao Zhang, Dongbin Zhao, He Wang",2023-11-27,"Robotic agents must master common sense and long-term sequential decisions to solve daily tasks through natural language instruction. The developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing have inspired efforts to use LLMs in complex robot planning. Despite LLMs' great generalization and comprehension of instruction tasks, LLMs-generated task plans sometimes lack feasibility and correctness. To address the problem, we propose a RoboGPT agent\footnote{our code and dataset will be released soon} for making embodied long-term decisions for daily tasks, with two modules: 1) LLMs-based planning with re-plan to break the task into multiple sub-goals; 2) RoboSkill individually designed for sub-goals to learn better navigation and manipulation skills. The LLMs-based planning is enhanced with a new robotic dataset and re-plan, called RoboGPT. The new robotic dataset of 67k daily instruction tasks is gathered for fine-tuning the Llama model and obtaining RoboGPT. RoboGPT planner with strong generalization can plan hundreds of daily instruction tasks. Additionally, a low-computational Re-Plan module is designed to allow plans to flexibly adapt to the environment, thereby addressing the nomenclature diversity challenge. The proposed RoboGPT agent outperforms SOTA methods on the ALFRED daily tasks. Moreover, RoboGPT planner exceeds SOTA LLM-based planners like ChatGPT in task-planning rationality for hundreds of unseen daily tasks, and even other domain tasks, while keeping the large model's original broad application and generality.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15649v2

We empirically demonstrate how the performance of an LLM contrasts with combinatorial search (CS) -- an approach that has been traditionally used to solve model space tasks in planning, both with the LLM in the role of a standalone model space reasoner as well as in the role of a statistical signal in concert with the CS approach as part of a two-stage process.

This approach is centered on understanding how these agents can effectively identify and utilize alternative objects when executing household tasks, thereby offering insights into the complexities of practical decision-making in real-world environments.Drawing inspiration from human decision-making, we explore how large language models tackle this challenge through three meticulously crafted commonsense question-and-answer datasets, featuring refined rules and human annotations. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art language models on these datasets sheds light on three pivotal considerations: 1) aligning an object's inherent utility with the task at hand, 2) navigating contextual dependencies (societal norms, safety, appropriateness, and efficiency), and 3) accounting for the current physical state of the object. To maintain accessibility, we introduce five abstract variables reflecting an object's physical condition, modulated by human insights to simulate diverse household scenarios. Our contributions include insightful Object-Utility mappings addressing the first consideration and two extensive QA datasets (15k and 130k questions) probing the intricacies of contextual dependencies and object states. The datasets, along with our findings, are accessible at: \url{https://github.com/com-phy-affordance/COAT}.

A Safer Vision-based Autonomous Planning System for Quadrotor UAVs with Dynamic Obstacle Trajectory Prediction and Its Application with LLMs,"Jiageng Zhong, Ming Li, Yinliang Chen, Zihang Wei, Fan Yang, Haoran Shen",2023-11-21,"For intelligent quadcopter UAVs, a robust and reliable autonomous planning system is crucial. Most current trajectory planning methods for UAVs are suitable for static environments but struggle to handle dynamic obstacles, which can pose challenges and even dangers to flight. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based planning system that combines tracking and trajectory prediction of dynamic obstacles to achieve efficient and reliable autonomous flight. We use a lightweight object detection algorithm to identify dynamic obstacles and then use Kalman Filtering to track and estimate their motion states. During the planning phase, we not only consider static obstacles but also account for the potential movements of dynamic obstacles. For trajectory generation, we use a B-spline-based trajectory search algorithm, which is further optimized with various constraints to enhance safety and alignment with the UAV's motion characteristics. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world environments, and the results indicate that our approach can successfully detect and avoid obstacles in dynamic environments in real-time, offering greater reliability compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, with the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology demonstrating exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, more user-friendly human-machine interactions have become feasible, and this study also explores the integration of autonomous planning systems with Large Language Models (LLMs).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12893v2
InteraSSort: Interactive Assortment Planning Using Large Language Models,"Saketh Reddy Karra, Theja Tulabandhula",2023-11-20,"Assortment planning, integral to multiple commercial offerings, is a key problem studied in e-commerce and retail settings. Numerous variants of the problem along with their integration into business solutions have been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature.

These challenges frequently necessitate collaborative efforts with multiple stakeholders which often lead to prolonged decision-making processes and significant delays. To mitigate these challenges and capitalize on the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose an interactive assortment planning framework, InteraSSort that augments LLMs with optimization tools to assist store planners in making decisions through interactive conversations.

However, real-world complex systems present three prevalent challenges concerning task planning and tool usage: (1) The real system usually has a vast array of APIs, so it is impossible to feed the descriptions of all APIs to the prompt of LLMs as the token length is limited; (2) the real system is designed for handling complex tasks, and the base LLMs can hardly plan a correct sub-task order and API-calling order for such tasks; (3) Similar semantics and functionalities among APIs in real systems create challenges for both LLMs and even humans in distinguishing between them.

However, several significant challenges remain: (i) most of these models rely on 2D images yet exhibit a limited capacity for 3D input; (ii) these models rarely explore the tasks inherently defined in 3D world, e.g., 3D grounding, embodied reasoning and acting. We argue these limitations significantly hinder current models from performing real-world tasks and approaching general intelligence.

Distilling and Retrieving Generalizable Knowledge for Robot Manipulation via Language Corrections,"Lihan Zha, Yuchen Cui, Li-Heng Lin, Minae Kwon, Montserrat Gonzalez Arenas, Andy Zeng, Fei Xia, Dorsa Sadigh",2023-11-17,"Today's robot policies exhibit subpar performance when faced with the challenge of generalizing to novel environments. Human corrective feedback is a crucial form of guidance to enable such generalization. However, adapting to and learning from online human corrections is a non-trivial endeavor: not only do robots need to remember human feedback over time to retrieve the right information in new settings and reduce the intervention rate, but also they would need to be able to respond to feedback that can be arbitrary corrections about high-level human preferences to low-level adjustments to skill parameters. In this work, we present Distillation and Retrieval of Online Corrections (DROC), a large language model (LLM)-based system that can respond to arbitrary forms of language feedback, distill generalizable knowledge from corrections, and retrieve relevant past experiences based on textual and visual similarity for improving performance in novel settings. DROC is able to respond to a sequence of online language corrections that address failures in both high-level task plans and low-level skill primitives. We demonstrate that DROC effectively distills the relevant information from the sequence of online corrections in a knowledge base and retrieves that knowledge in settings with new task or object instances. DROC outperforms other techniques that directly generate robot code via LLMs by using only half of the total number of corrections needed in the first round and requires little to no corrections after two iterations.

INTERVENOR: Prompting the Coding Ability of Large Language Models with the Interactive Chain of Repair,"Hanbin Wang, Zhenghao Liu, Shuo Wang, Ganqu Cui, Ning Ding, Zhiyuan Liu, Ge Yu",2023-11-16,"This paper introduces INTERVENOR (INTERactiVE chaiN Of Repair), a system designed to emulate the interactive code repair processes observed in humans, encompassing both code diagnosis and code repair. INTERVENOR prompts Large Language Models (LLMs) to play distinct roles during the code repair process, functioning as both a Code Learner and a Code Teacher. Specifically, the Code Learner is tasked with adhering to instructions to generate or repair code, while the Code Teacher is responsible for crafting a Chain-of-Repair (CoR) to serve as guidance for the Code Learner. During generating the CoR, the Code Teacher needs to check the generated codes from Code Learner and reassess how to address code bugs based on error feedback received from compilers. Experimental results demonstrate that INTERVENOR surpasses baseline models, exhibiting improvements of approximately 18% and 4.3% over GPT-3.5 in code generation and code translation tasks, respectively.

"OVM, Outcome-supervised Value Models for Planning in Mathematical Reasoning","Fei Yu, Anningzhe Gao, Benyou Wang",2023-11-16,"Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining accuracy throughout multiple multiple reasoning steps, especially in mathematical reasoning where an error in earlier steps can propagate to subsequent ones and it ultimately leading to an incorrect answer. To reduce error propagation, guided decoding is employed to direct the LM decoding on a step-by-step basis. We argue that in guided decoding, assessing the potential of an incomplete reasoning path can be more advantageous than simply ensuring per-step correctness, as the former approach leads towards a correct final answer. This transforms the task into a $\textit{value estimation}$ problem in planning.   Inspired by the findings that $\textit{outcome supervision for guided decoding essentially acts as a value model}$, we propose Outcome-supervised Value Model (OVM) that employs outcome supervision for training a value model, which prioritizes steps that lead to accurate conclusions. Furthermore, the OVM eliminates the need for labor-intensive annotations of step-level correctness, thereby significantly enhancing its scalability. Our experiments on two multi-step mathematical reasoning datasets, GSM8K and Game of 24, demonstrate the superior performance of the OVM model. Notably, in GSM8K, our $\textbf{OVM-7B model achieves state-of-the-art results among LLMs up to 13B parameters}$; especially it does not utilize GPT-4 or code execution.

Therefore, we investigated if an AI itself could autonomously generate and verify hypothesis for a toy machine learning research problem. We prompted GPT-4 to generate hypotheses and Python code for hypothesis verification with limited methodological guidance. Our findings suggest that, in some instances, GPT-4 can autonomously generate and validate hypotheses without detailed guidance. While this is a promising result, we also found that none of the verifications were flawless, and there remain significant challenges in achieving autonomous, human-level research using only generic instructions.

We fill this gap by infusing into the meta-prompt three key components: detailed descriptions, context specification, and a step-by-step reasoning template. The resulting method, named PE2, exhibits remarkable versatility across diverse language tasks. It finds prompts that outperform ""let's think step by step"" by 6.3% on MultiArith and 3.1% on GSM8K, and outperforms competitive baselines on counterfactual tasks by 6.9%. Further, we show that PE2 can make targeted and highly specific prompt edits, rectify erroneous prompts, and induce multi-step plans for complex tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05661v3
ADaPT: As-Needed Decomposition and Planning with Language Models,"Archiki Prasad, Alexander Koller, Mareike Hartmann, Peter Clark, Ashish Sabharwal, Mohit Bansal, Tushar Khot",2023-11-08,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for interactive decision-making tasks requiring planning and adapting to the environment. Recent works employ LLMs-as-agents in broadly two ways: iteratively determining the next action (iterative executors) or generating plans and executing sub-tasks using LLMs (plan-and-execute). However, these methods struggle with task complexity, as the inability to execute any sub-task may lead to task failure. To address these shortcomings, we introduce As-Needed Decomposition and Planning for complex Tasks (ADaPT), an approach that explicitly plans and decomposes complex sub-tasks as-needed, i.e., when the LLM is unable to execute them. ADaPT recursively decomposes sub-tasks to adapt to both task complexity and LLM capability. Our results demonstrate that ADaPT substantially outperforms established strong baselines, achieving success rates up to 28.3% higher in ALFWorld, 27% in WebShop, and 33% in TextCraft -- a novel compositional dataset that we introduce. Through extensive analysis, we illustrate the importance of multilevel decomposition and establish that ADaPT dynamically adjusts to the capabilities of the executor LLM as well as to task complexity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05772v2
Benefits and Harms of Large Language Models in Digital Mental Health,"Munmun De Choudhury, Sachin R. Pendse, Neha Kumar",2023-11-07,"The past decade has been transformative for mental health research and practice. The ability to harness large repositories of data, whether from electronic health records (EHR), mobile devices, or social media, has revealed a potential for valuable insights into patient experiences, promising early, proactive interventions, as well as personalized treatment plans. Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), show promise in leading digital mental health to uncharted territory. Patients are arriving at doctors' appointments with information sourced from chatbots, state-of-the-art LLMs are being incorporated in medical software and EHR systems, and chatbots from an ever-increasing number of startups promise to serve as AI companions, friends, and partners. This article presents contemporary perspectives on the opportunities and risks posed by LLMs in the design, development, and implementation of digital mental health tools. We adopt an ecological framework and draw on the affordances offered by LLMs to discuss four application areas -- care-seeking behaviors from individuals in need of care, community care provision, institutional and medical care provision, and larger care ecologies at the societal level. We engage in a thoughtful consideration of whether and how LLM-based technologies could or should be employed for enhancing mental health. The benefits and harms our article surfaces could serve to help shape future research, advocacy, and regulatory efforts focused on creating more responsible, user-friendly, equitable, and secure LLM-based tools for mental health treatment and intervention.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14693v1
Kinematic-aware Prompting for Generalizable Articulated Object Manipulation with LLMs,"Wenke Xia, Dong Wang, Xincheng Pang, Zhigang Wang, Bin Zhao, Di Hu, Xuelong Li",2023-11-06,"Generalizable articulated object manipulation is essential for home-assistant robots. Recent efforts focus on imitation learning from demonstrations or reinforcement learning in simulation, however, due to the prohibitive costs of real-world data collection and precise object simulation, it still remains challenging for these works to achieve broad adaptability across diverse articulated objects. Recently, many works have tried to utilize the strong in-context learning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve generalizable robotic manipulation, but most of these researches focus on high-level task planning, sidelining low-level robotic control. In this work, building on the idea that the kinematic structure of the object determines how we can manipulate it, we propose a kinematic-aware prompting framework that prompts LLMs with kinematic knowledge of objects to generate low-level motion trajectory waypoints, supporting various object manipulation. To effectively prompt LLMs with the kinematic structure of different objects, we design a unified kinematic knowledge parser, which represents various articulated objects as a unified textual description containing kinematic joints and contact location. Building upon this unified description, a kinematic-aware planner model is proposed to generate precise 3D manipulation waypoints via a designed kinematic-aware chain-of-thoughts prompting method. Our evaluation spanned 48 instances across 16 distinct categories, revealing that our framework not only outperforms traditional methods on 8 seen categories but also shows a powerful zero-shot capability for 8 unseen articulated object categories. Moreover, the real-world experiments on 7 different object categories prove our framework's adaptability in practical scenarios.

Make a Donut: Hierarchical EMD-Space Planning for Zero-Shot Deformable Manipulation with Tools,"Yang You, Bokui Shen, Congyue Deng, Haoran Geng, Songlin Wei, He Wang, Leonidas Guibas",2023-11-05,"Deformable object manipulation stands as one of the most captivating yet formidable challenges in robotics. While previous techniques have predominantly relied on learning latent dynamics through demonstrations, typically represented as either particles or images, there exists a pertinent limitation: acquiring suitable demonstrations, especially for long-horizon tasks, can be elusive. Moreover, basing learning entirely on demonstrations can hamper the model's ability to generalize beyond the demonstrated tasks. In this work, we introduce a demonstration-free hierarchical planning approach capable of tackling intricate long-horizon tasks without necessitating any training. We employ large language models (LLMs) to articulate a high-level, stage-by-stage plan corresponding to a specified task. For every individual stage, the LLM provides both the tool's name and the Python code to craft intermediate subgoal point clouds. With the tool and subgoal for a particular stage at our disposal, we present a granular closed-loop model predictive control strategy. This leverages Differentiable Physics with Point-to-Point correspondence (DiffPhysics-P2P) loss in the earth mover distance (EMD) space, applied iteratively. Experimental findings affirm that our technique surpasses multiple benchmarks in dough manipulation, spanning both short and long horizons. Remarkably, our model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities to novel and previously unencountered complex tasks without any preliminary demonstrations. We further substantiate our approach with experimental trials on real-world robotic platforms. Our project page: https://qq456cvb.github.io/projects/donut.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02787v2
FloodBrain: Flood Disaster Reporting by Web-based Retrieval Augmented Generation with an LLM,"Grace Colverd, Paul Darm, Leonard Silverberg, Noah Kasmanoff",2023-11-05,"Fast disaster impact reporting is crucial in planning humanitarian assistance. Large Language Models (LLMs) are well known for their ability to write coherent text and fulfill a variety of tasks relevant to impact reporting, such as question answering or text summarization. However, LLMs are constrained by the knowledge within their training data and are prone to generating inaccurate, or ""hallucinated"", information. To address this, we introduce a sophisticated pipeline embodied in our tool FloodBrain (floodbrain.com), specialized in generating flood disaster impact reports by extracting and curating information from the web. Our pipeline assimilates information from web search results to produce detailed and accurate reports on flood events. We test different LLMs as backbones in our tool and compare their generated reports to human-written reports on different metrics. Similar to other studies, we find a notable correlation between the scores assigned by GPT-4 and the scores given by human evaluators when comparing our generated reports to human-authored ones. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to test our single pipeline components and their relevancy for the final reports.

Our system aims to extract individual preferences from conversations and suggest options that satisfy the preferences of the members. We specifically apply this system to corporate meeting scheduling. We create synthetic employee profiles and simulate conversations at scale, leveraging LLMs to evaluate the system performance as a novel approach to conducting a user study.

ViLaIn can refine generated PDs via error message feedback from the symbolic planner. Our aim is to answer the question: How accurately can ViLaIn and the symbolic planner generate valid robot plans? To evaluate ViLaIn, we introduce a novel dataset called the problem description generation (ProDG) dataset. The framework is evaluated with four new evaluation metrics.

Plug-and-Play Policy Planner for Large Language Model Powered Dialogue Agents,"Yang Deng, Wenxuan Zhang, Wai Lam, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua",2023-11-01,"Proactive dialogues serve as a practical yet challenging dialogue problem in the era of large language models (LLMs), where the dialogue policy planning is the key to improving the proactivity of LLMs. Most existing studies enable the dialogue policy planning of LLMs using various prompting schemes or iteratively enhance this capability in handling the given case with verbal AI feedback. However, these approaches are either bounded by the policy planning capability of the frozen LLMs or hard to be transferred to new cases. In this work, we introduce a new dialogue policy planning paradigm to strategize LLMs for proactive dialogue problems with a tunable language model plug-in as a plug-and-play dialogue policy planner, named PPDPP. Specifically, we develop a novel training framework to facilitate supervised fine-tuning over available human-annotated data as well as reinforcement learning from goal-oriented AI feedback with dynamic interaction data collected by the LLM-based self-play simulation. In this manner, the LLM-powered dialogue agent can not only be generalized to different cases after the training, but also be applicable to different applications by just substituting the learned plug-in. In addition, we propose to evaluate the policy planning capability of dialogue systems under the interactive setting.

Large Trajectory Models are Scalable Motion Predictors and Planners,"Qiao Sun, Shiduo Zhang, Danjiao Ma, Jingzhe Shi, Derun Li, Simian Luo, Yu Wang, Ningyi Xu, Guangzhi Cao, Hang Zhao",2023-10-30,"Motion prediction and planning are vital tasks in autonomous driving, and recent efforts have shifted to machine learning-based approaches. The challenges include understanding diverse road topologies, reasoning traffic dynamics over a long time horizon, interpreting heterogeneous behaviors, and generating policies in a large continuous state space.

STR reformulates the motion prediction and motion planning problems by arranging observations, states, and actions into one unified sequence modeling task. Our approach unites trajectory generation problems with other sequence modeling problems, powering rapid iterations with breakthroughs in neighbor domains such as language modeling. Remarkably, experimental results reveal that large trajectory models (LTMs), such as STR, adhere to the scaling laws by presenting outstanding adaptability and learning efficiency. Qualitative results further demonstrate that LTMs are capable of making plausible predictions in scenarios that diverge significantly from the training data distribution.

The method synthesizes automaton-based controllers from pre-trained models guided by natural language task descriptions. These controllers are verifiable against independently provided specifications within a world model, which can be abstract or obtained from a high-fidelity simulator. Controllers with high compliance with the desired specifications receive higher ranks, guiding the iterative fine-tuning process.

ToolChain*: Efficient Action Space Navigation in Large Language Models with A* Search,"Yuchen Zhuang, Xiang Chen, Tong Yu, Saayan Mitra, Victor Bursztyn, Ryan A. Rossi, Somdeb Sarkhel, Chao Zhang",2023-10-20,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful decision-making and planning capabilities in solving complicated real-world problems. LLM-based autonomous agents can interact with diverse tools (e.g., functional APIs) and generate solution plans that execute a series of API function calls in a step-by-step manner. The multitude of candidate API function calls significantly expands the action space, amplifying the critical need for efficient action space navigation. However, existing methods either struggle with unidirectional exploration in expansive action spaces, trapped into a locally optimal solution, or suffer from exhaustively traversing all potential actions, causing inefficient navigation. To address these issues, we propose ToolChain*, an efficient tree search-based planning algorithm for LLM-based agents. It formulates the entire action space as a decision tree, where each node represents a possible API function call involved in a solution plan. By incorporating the A* search algorithm with task-specific cost function design, it efficiently prunes high-cost branches that may involve incorrect actions, identifying the most low-cost valid path as the solution. Extensive experiments on multiple tool-use and reasoning tasks demonstrate that ToolChain* efficiently balances exploration and exploitation within an expansive action space.

Eliminating Reasoning via Inferring with Planning: A New Framework to Guide LLMs' Non-linear Thinking,"Yongqi Tong, Yifan Wang, Dawei Li, Sizhe Wang, Zi Lin, Simeng Han, Jingbo Shang",2023-10-18,"Chain-of-Thought(CoT) prompting and its variants explore equipping large language models (LLMs) with high-level reasoning abilities by emulating human-like linear cognition and logic. However, the human mind is complicated and mixed with both linear and nonlinear thinking. In this work, we propose \textbf{I}nferential \textbf{E}xclusion \textbf{P}rompting (IEP), a novel prompting that combines the principles of elimination and inference in order to guide LLMs to think non-linearly. IEP guides LLMs to plan and then utilize Natural Language Inference (NLI) to deduce each possible solution's entailment relation with context, commonsense, or facts, therefore yielding a broader perspective by thinking back for inferring. This forward planning and backward eliminating process allows IEP to better simulate the complex human thinking processes compared to other CoT-based methods, which only reflect linear cognitive processes. We conducted a series of empirical studies and have corroborated that IEP consistently outperforms CoT across various tasks. Additionally, we observe that integrating IEP and CoT further improves the LLMs' performance on certain tasks, highlighting the necessity of equipping LLMs with mixed logic processes.

Then we studied how well it can perform across 30 real-world language-based tasks, such as ""open the bottle cap"" and ""wipe the plate with the sponge"", and we investigated which design choices in this prompt are the most important. Our conclusions raise the assumed limit of LLMs for robotics, and we reveal for the first time that LLMs do indeed possess an understanding of low-level robot control sufficient for a range of common tasks, and that they can additionally detect failures and then re-plan trajectories accordingly.

Leveraging Large Language Model for Automatic Evolving of Industrial Data-Centric R&D Cycle,"Xu Yang, Xiao Yang, Weiqing Liu, Jinhui Li, Peng Yu, Zeqi Ye, Jiang Bian",2023-10-17,"In the wake of relentless digital transformation, data-driven solutions are emerging as powerful tools to address multifarious industrial tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, planning, and even complex decision-making. Although data-centric R&D has been pivotal in harnessing these solutions, it often comes with significant costs in terms of human, computational, and time resources. This paper delves into the potential of large language models (LLMs) to expedite the evolution cycle of data-centric R&D. Assessing the foundational elements of data-centric R&D, including heterogeneous task-related data, multi-facet domain knowledge, and diverse computing-functional tools, we explore how well LLMs can understand domain-specific requirements, generate professional ideas, utilize domain-specific tools to conduct experiments, interpret results, and incorporate knowledge from past endeavors to tackle new challenges.

Interactive Task Planning with Language Models,"Boyi Li, Philipp Wu, Pieter Abbeel, Jitendra Malik",2023-10-16,"An interactive robot framework accomplishes long-horizon task planning and can easily generalize to new goals or distinct tasks, even during execution. However, most traditional methods require predefined module design, which makes it hard to generalize to different goals. Recent large language model based approaches can allow for more open-ended planning but often require heavy prompt engineering or domain-specific pretrained models. To tackle this, we propose a simple framework that achieves interactive task planning with language models. Our system incorporates both high-level planning and low-level function execution via language. We verify the robustness of our system in generating novel high-level instructions for unseen objectives and its ease of adaptation to different tasks by merely substituting the task guidelines, without the need for additional complex prompt engineering. Furthermore, when the user sends a new request, our system is able to replan accordingly with precision based on the new request, task guidelines and previously executed steps.

BioPlanner: Automatic Evaluation of LLMs on Protocol Planning in Biology,"Odhran O'Donoghue, Aleksandar Shtedritski, John Ginger, Ralph Abboud, Ali Essa Ghareeb, Justin Booth, Samuel G Rodriques",2023-10-16,"The ability to automatically generate accurate protocols for scientific experiments would represent a major step towards the automation of science. Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities on a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and the generation of coherent text and code. However, LLMs can struggle with multi-step problems and long-term planning, which are crucial for designing scientific experiments. Moreover, evaluation of the accuracy of scientific protocols is challenging, because experiments can be described correctly in many different ways, require expert knowledge to evaluate, and cannot usually be executed automatically. Here we present an automatic evaluation framework for the task of planning experimental protocols, and we introduce BioProt: a dataset of biology protocols with corresponding pseudocode representations. To measure performance on generating scientific protocols, we use an LLM to convert a natural language protocol into pseudocode, and then evaluate an LLM's ability to reconstruct the pseudocode from a high-level description and a list of admissible pseudocode functions. We evaluate GPT-3 and GPT-4 on this task and explore their robustness. We externally validate the utility of pseudocode representations of text by generating accurate novel protocols using retrieved pseudocode, and we run a generated protocol successfully in our biological laboratory. Our framework is extensible to the evaluation and improvement of language model planning abilities in other areas of science or other areas that lack automatic evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10632v1

To this end, we present video language planning (VLP), an algorithm that consists of a tree search procedure, where we train (i) vision-language models to serve as both policies and value functions, and (ii) text-to-video models as dynamics models. VLP takes as input a long-horizon task instruction and current image observation, and outputs a long video plan that provides detailed multimodal (video and language) specifications that describe how to complete the final task. VLP scales with increasing computation budget where more computation time results in improved video plans, and is able to synthesize long-horizon video plans across different robotics domains: from multi-object rearrangement, to multi-camera bi-arm dexterous manipulation. Generated video plans can be translated into real robot actions via goal-conditioned policies, conditioned on each intermediate frame of the generated video.

Theory of Mind for Multi-Agent Collaboration via Large Language Models,"Huao Li, Yu Quan Chong, Simon Stepputtis, Joseph Campbell, Dana Hughes, Michael Lewis, Katia Sycara",2023-10-16,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive accomplishments in both reasoning and planning, their abilities in multi-agent collaborations remains largely unexplored. This study evaluates LLM-based agents in a multi-agent cooperative text game with Theory of Mind (ToM) inference tasks, comparing their performance with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and planning-based baselines. We observed evidence of emergent collaborative behaviors and high-order Theory of Mind capabilities among LLM-based agents. Our results reveal limitations in LLM-based agents' planning optimization due to systematic failures in managing long-horizon contexts and hallucination about the task state. We explore the use of explicit belief state representations to mitigate these issues, finding that it enhances task performance and the accuracy of ToM inferences for LLM-based agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10701v3
Navigation with Large Language Models: Semantic Guesswork as a Heuristic for Planning,"Dhruv Shah, Michael Equi, Blazej Osinski, Fei Xia, Brian Ichter, Sergey Levine",2023-10-16,"Navigation in unfamiliar environments presents a major challenge for robots: while mapping and planning techniques can be used to build up a representation of the world, quickly discovering a path to a desired goal in unfamiliar settings with such methods often requires lengthy mapping and exploration. Humans can rapidly navigate new environments, particularly indoor environments that are laid out logically, by leveraging semantics -- e.g., a kitchen often adjoins a living room, an exit sign indicates the way out, and so forth. Language models can provide robots with such knowledge, but directly using language models to instruct a robot how to reach some destination can also be impractical: while language models might produce a narrative about how to reach some goal, because they are not grounded in real-world observations, this narrative might be arbitrarily wrong. Therefore, in this paper we study how the ``semantic guesswork'' produced by language models can be utilized as a guiding heuristic for planning algorithms. Our method, Language Frontier Guide (LFG), uses the language model to bias exploration of novel real-world environments by incorporating the semantic knowledge stored in language models as a search heuristic for planning with either topological or metric maps. We evaluate LFG in challenging real-world environments and simulated benchmarks, outperforming uninformed exploration and other ways of using language models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10103v1
Mastering Robot Manipulation with Multimodal Prompts through Pretraining and Multi-task Fine-tuning,"Jiachen Li, Qiaozi Gao, Michael Johnston, Xiaofeng Gao, Xuehai He, Suhaila Shakiah, Hangjie Shi, Reza Ghanadan, William Yang Wang",2023-10-14,"Prompt-based learning has been demonstrated as a compelling paradigm contributing to large language models' tremendous success (LLMs).

This type of task poses a major challenge to robots' capability to understand the interconnection and complementarity between vision and language signals. In this work, we introduce an effective framework that learns a policy to perform robot manipulation with multimodal prompts from multi-task expert trajectories. Our methods consist of a two-stage training pipeline that performs inverse dynamics pretraining and multi-task finetuning. To facilitate multimodal understanding, we design our multimodal prompt encoder by augmenting a pretrained LM with a residual connection to the visual input and model the dependencies among action dimensions. Empirically, we evaluate the efficacy of our method on the VIMA-BENCH and establish a new state-of-the-art (10% improvement in success rate).

LgTS: Dynamic Task Sampling using LLM-generated sub-goals for Reinforcement Learning Agents,"Yash Shukla, Wenchang Gao, Vasanth Sarathy, Alvaro Velasquez, Robert Wright, Jivko Sinapov",2023-10-14,"Recent advancements in reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLM) has promoted their usage in problems that require high-level planning for robots and artificial agents. However, current techniques that utilize LLMs for such planning tasks make certain key assumptions such as, access to datasets that permit finetuning, meticulously engineered prompts that only provide relevant and essential information to the LLM, and most importantly, a deterministic approach to allow execution of the LLM responses either in the form of existing policies or plan operators. In this work, we propose LgTS (LLM-guided Teacher-Student learning), a novel approach that explores the planning abilities of LLMs to provide a graphical representation of the sub-goals to a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that does not have access to the transition dynamics of the environment. The RL agent uses Teacher-Student learning algorithm to learn a set of successful policies for reaching the goal state from the start state while simultaneously minimizing the number of environmental interactions. Unlike previous methods that utilize LLMs, our approach does not assume access to a propreitary or a fine-tuned LLM, nor does it require pre-trained policies that achieve the sub-goals proposed by the LLM. Through experiments on a gridworld based DoorKey domain and a search-and-rescue inspired domain, we show that generating a graphical structure of sub-goals helps in learning policies for the LLM proposed sub-goals and the Teacher-Student learning algorithm minimizes the number of environment interactions when the transition dynamics are unknown.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09454v1
Interactive Navigation in Environments with Traversable Obstacles Using Large Language and Vision-Language Models,"Zhen Zhang, Anran Lin, Chun Wai Wong, Xiangyu Chu, Qi Dou, K. W. Samuel Au",2023-10-13,"This paper proposes an interactive navigation framework by using large language and vision-language models, allowing robots to navigate in environments with traversable obstacles. We utilize the large language model (GPT-3.5) and the open-set Vision-language Model (Grounding DINO) to create an action-aware costmap to perform effective path planning without fine-tuning. With the large models, we can achieve an end-to-end system from textual instructions like ""Can you pass through the curtains to deliver medicines to me?"", to bounding boxes (e.g., curtains) with action-aware attributes. They can be used to segment LiDAR point clouds into two parts: traversable and untraversable parts, and then an action-aware costmap is constructed for generating a feasible path. The pre-trained large models have great generalization ability and do not require additional annotated data for training, allowing fast deployment in the interactive navigation tasks. We choose to use multiple traversable objects such as curtains and grasses for verification by instructing the robot to traverse them. Besides, traversing curtains in a medical scenario was tested.

Specifically, SAFARI decouples the knowledge grounding into multiple sources and response generation, which allows easy extension to various knowledge sources including the possibility of not using any sources.

Tree-Planner: Efficient Close-loop Task Planning with Large Language Models,"Mengkang Hu, Yao Mu, Xinmiao Yu, Mingyu Ding, Shiguang Wu, Wenqi Shao, Qiguang Chen, Bin Wang, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo",2023-10-12,"This paper studies close-loop task planning, which refers to the process of generating a sequence of skills (a plan) to accomplish a specific goal while adapting the plan based on real-time observations. Recently, prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalent paradigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness. However, this paradigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundant error correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testing and applications. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Planner, which reframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling, action tree construction, and grounded deciding. Tree-Planner starts by using an LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by the aggregation of them to form an action tree. Finally, the LLM performs a top-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-time environmental information. Experiments show that Tree-Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency. By decomposing LLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-deciding calls, a considerable part of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedly consumed. As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2% compared to the previously best-performing model. Additionally, by enabling backtracking on the action tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading to a 40.5% decrease in error corrections.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08582v2
Towards Robust Multi-Modal Reasoning via Model Selection,"Xiangyan Liu, Rongxue Li, Wei Ji, Tao Lin",2023-10-12,"The reasoning capabilities of LLM (Large Language Model) are widely acknowledged in recent research, inspiring studies on tool learning and autonomous agents. LLM serves as the ""brain"" of the agent, orchestrating multiple tools for collaborative multi-step task solving. Unlike methods invoking tools like calculators or weather APIs for straightforward tasks, multi-modal agents excel by integrating diverse AI models for complex challenges. However, current multi-modal agents neglect the significance of model selection: they primarily focus on the planning and execution phases, and will only invoke predefined task-specific models for each subtask, making the execution fragile. Meanwhile, other traditional model selection methods are either incompatible with or suboptimal for the multi-modal agent scenarios, due to ignorance of dependencies among subtasks arising by multi-step reasoning. To this end, we identify the key challenges therein and propose the $\textit{M}^3$ framework as a plug-in with negligible runtime overhead at test-time. This framework improves model selection and bolsters the robustness of multi-modal agents in multi-step reasoning. In the absence of suitable benchmarks, we create MS-GQA, a new dataset specifically designed to investigate the model selection challenge in multi-modal agents.

EIPE-text has three stages: plan extraction, learning, and inference. In the plan extraction stage, it iteratively extracts and improves plans from the narrative corpus and constructs a plan corpus. We propose a question answer (QA) based evaluation mechanism to automatically evaluate the plans and generate detailed plan refinement instructions to guide the iterative improvement. In the learning stage, we build a better planner by fine-tuning with the plan corpus or in-context learning with examples in the plan corpus.

We evaluate a planning system that employs LLMs for both plan generation and verification. We assess the verifier LLM's performance against ground-truth verification, the impact of self-critiquing on plan generation, and the influence of varying feedback levels on system performance. Using GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, for both generation and verification, our findings reveal that self-critiquing appears to diminish plan generation performance, especially when compared to systems with external, sound verifiers and the LLM verifiers in that system produce a notable number of false positives, compromising the system's reliability.

Reverse Chain: A Generic-Rule for LLMs to Master Multi-API Planning,"Yinger Zhang, Hui Cai, Xeirui Song, Yicheng Chen, Rui Sun, Jing Zheng",2023-10-06,"While enabling large language models to implement function calling (known as APIs) can greatly enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), function calling is still a challenging task due to the complicated relations between different APIs, especially in a context-learning setting without fine-tuning.

Recognizing that most LLMs have limited tool-use capabilities, Reverse Chain limits LLMs to executing simple tasks, e.g., API Selection and Argument Completion. Furthermore, to manage a controllable multi-function calling, Reverse Chain adopts a generic rule based on a backward reasoning process.

Thought Propagation: An Analogical Approach to Complex Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Junchi Yu, Ran He, Rex Ying",2023-10-06,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in reasoning tasks with the development of prompting methods. However, existing prompting approaches cannot reuse insights of solving similar problems and suffer from accumulated errors in multi-step reasoning, since they prompt LLMs to reason \textit{from scratch}. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\textit{Thought Propagation} (TP)}, which explores the analogous problems and leverages their solutions to enhance the complex reasoning ability of LLMs. These analogous problems are related to the input one, with reusable solutions and problem-solving strategies. Thus, it is promising to propagate insights of solving previous analogous problems to inspire new problem-solving. To achieve this, TP first prompts LLMs to propose and solve a set of analogous problems that are related to the input one. Then, TP reuses the results of analogous problems to directly yield a new solution or derive a knowledge-intensive plan for execution to amend the initial solution obtained from scratch. TP is compatible with existing prompting approaches, allowing plug-and-play generalization and enhancement in a wide range of tasks without much labor in task-specific prompt engineering. Experiments across three challenging tasks demonstrate TP enjoys a substantial improvement over the baselines by an average of 12\% absolute increase in finding the optimal solutions in Shortest-path Reasoning, 13\% improvement of human preference in Creative Writing, and 15\% enhancement in the task completion rate of LLM-Agent Planning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03965v3
MLAgentBench: Evaluating Language Agents on Machine Learning Experimentation,"Qian Huang, Jian Vora, Percy Liang, Jure Leskovec",2023-10-05,"A central aspect of machine learning research is experimentation, the process of designing and running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating towards some positive outcome (e.g., improving accuracy). Could agents driven by powerful language models perform machine learning experimentation effectively? To answer this question, we introduce MLAgentBench, a suite of 13 tasks ranging from improving model performance on CIFAR-10 to recent research problems like BabyLM. For each task, an agent can perform actions like reading/writing files, executing code, and inspecting outputs. We then construct an agent that can perform ML experimentation based on ReAct framework. We benchmark agents based on Claude v1.0, Claude v2.1, Claude v3 Opus, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, Gemini-Pro, and Mixtral and find that a Claude v3 Opus agent is the best in terms of success rate. It can build compelling ML models over many tasks in MLAgentBench with 37.5% average success rate. Our agents also display highly interpretable plans and actions. However, the success rates vary considerably; they span from 100% on well-established older datasets to as low as 0% on recent Kaggle challenges created potentially after the underlying LM was trained. Finally, we identify several key challenges for LM-based agents such as long-term planning and reducing hallucination.

Improving Automatic VQA Evaluation Using Large Language Models,"Oscar Mañas, Benno Krojer, Aishwarya Agrawal",2023-10-04,"8 years after the visual question answering (VQA) task was proposed, accuracy remains the primary metric for automatic evaluation. VQA Accuracy has been effective so far in the IID evaluation setting. However, our community is undergoing a shift towards open-ended generative models and OOD evaluation. In this new paradigm, the existing VQA Accuracy metric is overly stringent and underestimates the performance of VQA systems. Thus, there is a need to develop more robust automatic VQA metrics that serve as a proxy for human judgment. In this work, we propose to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) to build a better VQA metric. We formulate VQA evaluation as an answer-rating task where the LLM is instructed to score the accuracy of a candidate answer given a set of reference answers. We demonstrate the proposed metric better correlates with human judgment compared to existing metrics across several VQA models and benchmarks. We hope wide adoption of our metric will contribute to better estimating the research progress on the VQA task. We plan to release the evaluation code and collected human judgments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02567v2
Can GPT-4 Replicate Empirical Software Engineering Research?,"Jenny T. Liang, Carmen Badea, Christian Bird, Robert DeLine, Denae Ford, Nicole Forsgren, Thomas Zimmermann",2023-10-03,"Empirical software engineering research on production systems has brought forth a better understanding of the software engineering process for practitioners and researchers alike. However, only a small subset of production systems is studied, limiting the impact of this research. While software engineering practitioners could benefit from replicating research on their own data, this poses its own set of challenges, since performing replications requires a deep understanding of research methodologies and subtle nuances in software engineering data. Given that large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, show promise in tackling both software engineering- and science-related tasks, these models could help replicate and thus democratize empirical software engineering research.   In this paper, we examine GPT-4's abilities to perform replications of empirical software engineering research on new data. We study their ability to surface assumptions made in empirical software engineering research methodologies, as well as their ability to plan and generate code for analysis pipelines on seven empirical software engineering papers. We perform a user study with 14 participants with software engineering research expertise, who evaluate GPT-4-generated assumptions and analysis plans (i.e., a list of module specifications) from the papers. We find that GPT-4 is able to surface correct assumptions, but struggles to generate ones that apply common knowledge about software engineering data. In a manual analysis of the generated code, we find that the GPT-4-generated code contains correct high-level logic, given a subset of the methodology. However, the code contains many small implementation-level errors, reflecting a lack of software engineering knowledge. Our findings have implications for leveraging LLMs for software engineering research as well as practitioner data scientists in software teams.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01727v3
SmartPlay: A Benchmark for LLMs as Intelligent Agents,"Yue Wu, Xuan Tang, Tom M. Mitchell, Yuanzhi Li",2023-10-02,"Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential toward intelligent agents and next-gen automation, but there currently lacks a systematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' abilities as agents. We introduce SmartPlay: both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs as agents. SmartPlay consists of 6 different games, including Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each game test allows us to analyze each capability separately. SmartPlay serves not only as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM agents but also as a road-map for identifying gaps in current methodologies.

GPT-Driver: Learning to Drive with GPT,"Jiageng Mao, Yuxi Qian, Junjie Ye, Hang Zhao, Yue Wang",2023-10-02,"We present a simple yet effective approach that can transform the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model into a reliable motion planner for autonomous vehicles. Motion planning is a core challenge in autonomous driving, aiming to plan a driving trajectory that is safe and comfortable. Existing motion planners predominantly leverage heuristic methods to forecast driving trajectories, yet these approaches demonstrate insufficient generalization capabilities in the face of novel and unseen driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to motion planning that capitalizes on the strong reasoning capabilities and generalization potential inherent to Large Language Models (LLMs). The fundamental insight of our approach is the reformulation of motion planning as a language modeling problem, a perspective not previously explored. Specifically, we represent the planner inputs and outputs as language tokens, and leverage the LLM to generate driving trajectories through a language description of coordinate positions. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompting-reasoning-finetuning strategy to stimulate the numerical reasoning potential of the LLM. With this strategy, the LLM can describe highly precise trajectory coordinates and also its internal decision-making process in natural language. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale nuScenes dataset, and extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of our GPT-based motion planner.

Probing the Multi-turn Planning Capabilities of LLMs via 20 Question Games,"Yizhe Zhang, Jiarui Lu, Navdeep Jaitly",2023-10-02,"Large language models (LLMs) are effective at answering questions that are clearly asked. However, when faced with ambiguous queries they can act unpredictably and produce incorrect outputs. This underscores the need for the development of intelligent agents capable of asking clarification questions to resolve ambiguities effectively. This capability requires complex understanding, state tracking, reasoning and planning over multiple conversational turns. However, directly measuring this can be challenging. In this paper, we offer a surrogate problem which assesses an LLMs's capability to deduce an entity unknown to itself, but revealed to a judge, by asking the judge a series of queries. This \textit{entity-deducing game} can serve as an evaluation framework to probe the conversational reasoning and planning capabilities of language models. We systematically evaluate various LLMs and discover significant differences in their performance on this task. We find that strong LLMs like GPT-4 outperform human players by a large margin. We further employ Behavior Cloning (BC) to examine whether a weaker model is capable of imitating a stronger model and generalizing to data or domains, using only the demonstrations from a stronger model. We finally propose to use Reinforcement Learning to enhance reasoning and planning capacity of Vicuna models through episodes of game playing, which lead to significant performance improvement. We hope that this problem offers insights into how autonomous agents could be trained to behave more intelligently in ambiguous circumstances.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01468v3
Reasoning on Graphs: Faithful and Interpretable Large Language Model Reasoning,"Linhao Luo, Yuan-Fang Li, Gholamreza Haffari, Shirui Pan",2023-10-02,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities in complex tasks. However, they lack up-to-date knowledge and experience hallucinations during reasoning, which can lead to incorrect reasoning processes and diminish their performance and trustworthiness. Knowledge graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. Nevertheless, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only treat KGs as factual knowledge bases and overlook the importance of their structural information for reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes LLMs with KGs to enable faithful and interpretable reasoning. Specifically, we present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG first generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans. These plans are then used to retrieve valid reasoning paths from the KGs for LLMs to conduct faithful reasoning. Furthermore, RoG not only distills knowledge from KGs to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs through training but also allows seamless integration with any arbitrary LLMs during inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning tasks and generates faithful and interpretable reasoning results.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01061v2
UPAR: A Kantian-Inspired Prompting Framework for Enhancing Large Language Model Capabilities,"Hejia Geng, Boxun Xu, Peng Li",2023-09-30,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive inferential capabilities, with numerous research endeavors devoted to enhancing this capacity through prompting. Despite these efforts, a unified epistemological foundation is still conspicuously absent. Drawing inspiration from Kant's a priori philosophy, we propose the UPAR prompting framework, designed to emulate the structure of human cognition within LLMs. The UPAR framework is delineated into four phases: ""Understand"", ""Plan"", ""Act"", and ""Reflect"", enabling the extraction of structured information from complex contexts, prior planning of solutions, execution according to plan, and self-reflection. This structure significantly augments the explainability and accuracy of LLM inference, producing a human-understandable and inspectable inferential trajectory. Furthermore, our work offers an epistemological foundation for existing prompting techniques, allowing for a possible systematic integration of these methods. With GPT-4, our approach elevates the accuracy from COT baseline of 22.92% to 58.33% in a challenging subset of GSM8K, and from 67.91% to 75.40% in the causal judgment task. Without using few-shot examples or external tools, UPAR significantly outperforms existing prompting methods on SCIBENCH, a challenging dataset containing collegiate-level mathematics, chemistry, and physics scientific problems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01441v2
A Prefrontal Cortex-inspired Architecture for Planning in Large Language Models,"Taylor Webb, Shanka Subhra Mondal, Chi Wang, Brian Krabach, Ida Momennejad",2023-09-30,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, but they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or goal-directed planning. To address this, we take inspiration from the human brain, in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent interaction of specialized modules in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These modules perform functions such as conflict monitoring, state prediction, state evaluation, task decomposition, and task coordination. We find that LLMs are sometimes capable of carrying out these functions in isolation, but struggle to autonomously coordinate them in the service of a goal. Therefore, we propose a black box architecture with multiple LLM-based (GPT-4) modules. The architecture improves planning through the interaction of specialized PFC-inspired modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief automated calls to the LLM. We evaluate the combined architecture on three challenging planning tasks -- graph traversal, Tower of Hanoi, and logistics -- finding that it yields significant improvements over standard LLM methods (e.g., zero-shot prompting, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought). These results demonstrate the benefit of utilizing knowledge from cognitive neuroscience to improve planning in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00194v3
"Reason for Future, Act for Now: A Principled Framework for Autonomous LLM Agents with Provable Sample Efficiency","Zhihan Liu, Hao Hu, Shenao Zhang, Hongyi Guo, Shuqi Ke, Boyi Liu, Zhaoran Wang",2023-09-29,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities, but translating reasoning into actions in the real world remains challenging. In particular, it remains unclear how to complete a given task provably within a minimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an internal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose a principled framework with provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we call ""reason for future, act for now"" (\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we design a prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a future trajectory over a long horizon (""reason for future""). At each step, the LLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (""act for now""), stores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning routine to replan the future trajectory from the new state.   The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in Bayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt LLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memory buffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps that maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planning subroutines are performed in an ""in-context"" manner to emulate the actor-critic update for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination of long-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\sqrt{T}$ regret. Here, $T$ denotes the number of online interactions. In particular, the regret bound highlights an intriguing interplay between the prior knowledge obtained through pretraining and the uncertainty reduction achieved by reasoning and acting. Our empirical validation shows that it outperforms various existing frameworks and achieves nearly perfect scores on a few benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17382v3
AutoAgents: A Framework for Automatic Agent Generation,"Guangyao Chen, Siwei Dong, Yu Shu, Ge Zhang, Jaward Sesay, Börje F.

However, most existing LLM-based multi-agent approaches rely on predefined agents to handle simple tasks, limiting the adaptability of multi-agent collaboration to different scenarios.

Specifically, AutoAgents couples the relationship between tasks and roles by dynamically generating multiple required agents based on task content and planning solutions for the current task based on the generated expert agents. Multiple specialized agents collaborate with each other to efficiently accomplish tasks. Concurrently, an observer role is incorporated into the framework to reflect on the designated plans and agents' responses and improve upon them. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that AutoAgents generates more coherent and accurate solutions than the existing multi-agent methods. This underscores the significance of assigning different roles to different tasks and of team cooperation, offering new perspectives for tackling complex tasks.

Suspicion-Agent: Playing Imperfect Information Games with Theory of Mind Aware GPT-4,"Jiaxian Guo, Bo Yang, Paul Yoo, Bill Yuchen Lin, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo",2023-09-29,"Unlike perfect information games, where all elements are known to every player, imperfect information games emulate the real-world complexities of decision-making under uncertain or incomplete information. GPT-4, the recent breakthrough in large language models (LLMs) trained on massive passive data, is notable for its knowledge retrieval and reasoning abilities. This paper delves into the applicability of GPT-4's learned knowledge for imperfect information games. To achieve this, we introduce \textbf{Suspicion-Agent}, an innovative agent that leverages GPT-4's capabilities for performing in imperfect information games. With proper prompt engineering to achieve different functions, Suspicion-Agent based on GPT-4 demonstrates remarkable adaptability across a range of imperfect information card games. Importantly, GPT-4 displays a strong high-order theory of mind (ToM) capacity, meaning it can understand others and intentionally impact others' behavior. Leveraging this, we design a planning strategy that enables GPT-4 to competently play against different opponents, adapting its gameplay style as needed, while requiring only the game rules and descriptions of observations as input. In the experiments, we qualitatively showcase the capabilities of Suspicion-Agent across three different imperfect information games and then quantitatively evaluate it in Leduc Hold'em. The results show that Suspicion-Agent can potentially outperform traditional algorithms designed for imperfect information games, without any specialized training or examples. In order to encourage and foster deeper insights within the community, we make our game-related data publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17277v2
Alphazero-like Tree-Search can Guide Large Language Model Decoding and Training,"Xidong Feng, Ziyu Wan, Muning Wen, Stephen Marcus McAleer, Ying Wen, Weinan Zhang, Jun Wang",2023-09-29,"Recent works like Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Reasoning via Planning (RAP) aim to augment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by using tree-search algorithms to guide multi-step reasoning. These methods rely on prompting a pre-trained model to serve as a value function and focus on problems with low search depth. As a result, these methods will not work in domains where the pre-trained LLM does not have enough knowledge to serve as an effective value function or in domains that require long-horizon planning. To address these limitations, we present an AlphaZero-like tree-search learning framework for LLMs (termed TS-LLM), systematically illustrating how tree-search with a learned value function can guide LLM decoding. TS-LLM distinguishes itself in two key ways. (1) Leveraging a learned value function and AlphaZero-like algorithms, our approach can be generally adaptable to a wide range of tasks, language models of any size, and tasks of varying search depths. (2) Our approach can guide LLMs during both inference and training, iteratively improving the LLM.

Promptbreeder: Self-Referential Self-Improvement Via Prompt Evolution,"Chrisantha Fernando, Dylan Banarse, Henryk Michalewski, Simon Osindero, Tim Rocktäschel",2023-09-28,"Popular prompt strategies like Chain-of-Thought Prompting can dramatically improve the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains. However, such hand-crafted prompt-strategies are often sub-optimal. In this paper, we present Promptbreeder, a general-purpose self-referential self-improvement mechanism that evolves and adapts prompts for a given domain. Driven by an LLM, Promptbreeder mutates a population of task-prompts, and subsequently evaluates them for fitness on a training set. Crucially, the mutation of these task-prompts is governed by mutation-prompts that the LLM generates and improves throughout evolution in a self-referential way. That is, Promptbreeder is not just improving task-prompts, but it is also improving the mutationprompts that improve these task-prompts.

Here, we represent continuous trajectories as sequences of discrete motion tokens and cast multi-agent motion prediction as a language modeling task over this domain. Our model, MotionLM, provides several advantages: First, it does not require anchors or explicit latent variable optimization to learn multimodal distributions. Instead, we leverage a single standard language modeling objective, maximizing the average log probability over sequence tokens. Second, our approach bypasses post-hoc interaction heuristics where individual agent trajectory generation is conducted prior to interactive scoring. Instead, MotionLM produces joint distributions over interactive agent futures in a single autoregressive decoding process.

Neuro Symbolic Reasoning for Planning: Counterexample Guided Inductive Synthesis using Large Language Models and Satisfiability Solving,"Sumit Kumar Jha, Susmit Jha, Patrick Lincoln, Nathaniel D. Bastian, Alvaro Velasquez, Rickard Ewetz, Sandeep Neema",2023-09-28,"Generative large language models (LLMs) with instruct training such as GPT-4 can follow human-provided instruction prompts and generate human-like responses to these prompts. Apart from natural language responses, they have also been found to be effective at generating formal artifacts such as code, plans, and logical specifications from natural language prompts. Despite their remarkably improved accuracy, these models are still known to produce factually incorrect or contextually inappropriate results despite their syntactic coherence - a phenomenon often referred to as hallucination. This limitation makes it difficult to use these models to synthesize formal artifacts that are used in safety-critical applications. Unlike tasks such as text summarization and question-answering, bugs in code, plan, and other formal artifacts produced by LLMs can be catastrophic. We posit that we can use the satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers as deductive reasoning engines to analyze the generated solutions from the LLMs, produce counterexamples when the solutions are incorrect, and provide that feedback to the LLMs exploiting the dialog capability of instruct-trained LLMs. This interaction between inductive LLMs and deductive SMT solvers can iteratively steer the LLM to generate the correct response. In our experiments, we use planning over the domain of blocks as our synthesis task for evaluating our approach. We use GPT-4, GPT3.5 Turbo, Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada as the LLMs and Z3 as the SMT solver. Our method allows the user to communicate the planning problem in natural language; even the formulation of queries to SMT solvers is automatically generated from natural language. Thus, the proposed technique can enable non-expert users to describe their problems in natural language, and the combination of LLMs and SMT solvers can produce provably correct solutions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16436v1
TPE: Towards Better Compositional Reasoning over Conceptual Tools with Multi-persona Collaboration,"Hongru Wang, Huimin Wang, Lingzhi Wang, Minda Hu, Rui Wang, Boyang Xue, Hongyuan Lu, Fei Mi, Kam-Fai Wong",2023-09-28,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in planning the use of various functional tools, such as calculators and retrievers, particularly in question-answering tasks. In this paper, we expand the definition of these tools, centering on conceptual tools within the context of dialogue systems. A conceptual tool specifies a cognitive concept that aids systematic or investigative thought. These conceptual tools play important roles in practice, such as multiple psychological or tutoring strategies being dynamically applied in a single turn to compose helpful responses. To further enhance the reasoning and planning capability of LLMs with these conceptual tools, we introduce a multi-persona collaboration framework: Think-Plan-Execute (TPE). This framework decouples the response generation process into three distinct roles: Thinker, Planner, and Executor. Specifically, the Thinker analyzes the internal status exhibited in the dialogue context, such as user emotions and preferences, to formulate a global guideline. The Planner then generates executable plans to call different conceptual tools (e.g., sources or strategies), while the Executor compiles all intermediate results into a coherent response. This structured approach not only enhances the explainability and controllability of responses but also reduces token redundancy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE across various dialogue response generation tasks, including multi-source (FoCus) and multi-strategy interactions (CIMA and PsyQA). This reveals its potential to handle real-world dialogue interactions that require more complicated tool learning beyond just functional tools. The full code and data will be released for reproduction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16090v1
VideoDirectorGPT: Consistent Multi-scene Video Generation via LLM-Guided Planning,"Han Lin, Abhay Zala, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal",2023-09-26,"Recent text-to-video (T2V) generation methods have seen significant advancements. However, the majority of these works focus on producing short video clips of a single event (i.e., single-scene videos). Meanwhile, recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capability in generating layouts and programs to control downstream visual modules. This prompts an important question: can we leverage the knowledge embedded in these LLMs for temporally consistent long video generation? In this paper, we propose VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for consistent multi-scene video generation that uses the knowledge of LLMs for video content planning and grounded video generation. Specifically, given a single text prompt, we first ask our video planner LLM (GPT-4) to expand it into a 'video plan', which includes the scene descriptions, the entities with their respective layouts, the background for each scene, and consistency groupings of the entities. Next, guided by this video plan, our video generator, named Layout2Vid, has explicit control over spatial layouts and can maintain temporal consistency of entities across multiple scenes, while being trained only with image-level annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed VideoDirectorGPT framework substantially improves layout and movement control in both single- and multi-scene video generation and can generate multi-scene videos with consistency, while achieving competitive performance with SOTAs in open-domain single-scene T2V generation. Detailed ablation studies, including dynamic adjustment of layout control strength with an LLM and video generation with user-provided images, confirm the effectiveness of each component of our framework and its future potential.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15091v2

Evaluating Cognitive Maps and Planning in Large Language Models with CogEval,"Ida Momennejad, Hosein Hasanbeig, Felipe Vieira, Hiteshi Sharma, Robert Osazuwa Ness, Nebojsa Jojic, Hamid Palangi, Jonathan Larson",2023-09-25,"Recently an influx of studies claim emergent cognitive abilities in large language models (LLMs). Yet, most rely on anecdotes, overlook contamination of training sets, or lack systematic Evaluation involving multiple tasks, control conditions, multiple iterations, and statistical robustness tests. Here we make two major contributions. First, we propose CogEval, a cognitive science-inspired protocol for the systematic evaluation of cognitive capacities in Large Language Models. The CogEval protocol can be followed for the evaluation of various abilities. Second, here we follow CogEval to systematically evaluate cognitive maps and planning ability across eight LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo-175B, davinci-003-175B, Google Bard, Cohere-xlarge-52.4B, Anthropic Claude-1-52B, LLaMA-13B, and Alpaca-7B). We base our task prompts on human experiments, which offer both established construct validity for evaluating planning, and are absent from LLM training sets. We find that, while LLMs show apparent competence in a few planning tasks with simpler structures, systematic evaluation reveals striking failure modes in planning tasks, including hallucinations of invalid trajectories and getting trapped in loops. These findings do not support the idea of emergent out-of-the-box planning ability in LLMs. This could be because LLMs do not understand the latent relational structures underlying planning problems, known as cognitive maps, and fail at unrolling goal-directed trajectories based on the underlying structure. Implications for application and future directions are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15129v1
Natural Language based Context Modeling and Reasoning for Ubiquitous Computing with Large Language Models: A Tutorial,"Haoyi Xiong, Jiang Bian, Sijia Yang, Xiaofei Zhang, Linghe Kong, Daqing Zhang",2023-09-24,"Large language models (LLMs) have become phenomenally surging, since 2018--two decades after introducing context-awareness into computing systems. Through taking into account the situations of ubiquitous devices, users and the societies, context-aware computing has enabled a wide spectrum of innovative applications, such as assisted living, location-based social network services and so on. To recognize contexts and make decisions for actions accordingly, various artificial intelligence technologies, such as Ontology and OWL, have been adopted as representations for context modeling and reasoning. Recently, with the rise of LLMs and their improved natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, it has become feasible to model contexts using natural language and perform context reasoning by interacting with LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. In this tutorial, we demonstrate the use of texts, prompts, and autonomous agents (AutoAgents) that enable LLMs to perform context modeling and reasoning without requiring fine-tuning of the model. We organize and introduce works in the related field, and name this computing paradigm as the LLM-driven Context-aware Computing (LCaC). In the LCaC paradigm, users' requests, sensors reading data, and the command to actuators are supposed to be represented as texts. Given the text of users' request and sensor data, the AutoAgent models the context by prompting and sends to the LLM for context reasoning. LLM generates a plan of actions and responds to the AutoAgent, which later follows the action plan to foster context-awareness. To prove the concepts, we use two showcases--(1) operating a mobile z-arm in an apartment for assisted living, and (2) planning a trip and scheduling the itinerary in a context-aware and personalized manner.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15074v2
An In-depth Survey of Large Language Model-based Artificial Intelligence Agents,"Pengyu Zhao, Zijian Jin, Ning Cheng",2023-09-23,"Due to the powerful capabilities demonstrated by large language model (LLM), there has been a recent surge in efforts to integrate them with AI agents to enhance their performance.

Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the key components of AI agents, including planning, memory, and tool use. Particularly, for the crucial component of memory, this paper introduced an innovative classification scheme, not only departing from traditional classification methods but also providing a fresh perspective on the design of an AI agent's memory system. We firmly believe that in-depth research and understanding of these core components will lay a solid foundation for the future advancement of AI agent technology.

You Only Look at Screens: Multimodal Chain-of-Action Agents,"Zhuosheng Zhang, Aston Zhang",2023-09-20,"Autonomous graphical user interface (GUI) agents aim to facilitate task automation by interacting with the user interface without manual intervention. Recent studies have investigated eliciting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for effective engagement in diverse environments. To align with the input-output requirement of LLMs, most existing approaches are developed under a sandbox setting where they rely on external tools and application-specific APIs to parse the environment into textual elements and interpret the predicted actions. Consequently, those approaches often grapple with inference inefficiency and error propagation risks. To mitigate the challenges, we introduce Auto-GUI, a multimodal solution that directly interacts with the interface, bypassing the need for environment parsing or reliance on application-dependent APIs. Moreover, we propose a chain-of-action technique -- leveraging a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans -- to help the agent decide what action to execute. We evaluate our approach on a new device-control benchmark AITW with 30$K$ unique instructions, spanning multi-step tasks such as application operation, web searching, and web shopping.

Discuss Before Moving: Visual Language Navigation via Multi-expert Discussions,"Yuxing Long, Xiaoqi Li, Wenzhe Cai, Hao Dong",2023-09-20,"Visual language navigation (VLN) is an embodied task demanding a wide range of skills encompassing understanding, perception, and planning. For such a multifaceted challenge, previous VLN methods totally rely on one model's own thinking to make predictions within one round. However, existing models, even the most advanced large language model GPT4, still struggle with dealing with multiple tasks by single-round self-thinking. In this work, drawing inspiration from the expert consultation meeting, we introduce a novel zero-shot VLN framework. Within this framework, large models possessing distinct abilities are served as domain experts. Our proposed navigation agent, namely DiscussNav, can actively discuss with these experts to collect essential information before moving at every step. These discussions cover critical navigation subtasks like instruction understanding, environment perception, and completion estimation. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that discussions with domain experts can effectively facilitate navigation by perceiving instruction-relevant information, correcting inadvertent errors, and sifting through in-consistent movement decisions. The performances on the representative VLN task R2R show that our method surpasses the leading zero-shot VLN model by a large margin on all metrics. Additionally, real-robot experiments display the obvious advantages of our method over single-round self-thinking.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11382v1

Motivated by these advancements, there has been a surge of interest among researchers to harness the capabilities of GPT-4 for the automated design of quantitative factors that do not overlap with existing factor libraries, with an aspiration to achieve alpha returns \cite{webpagequant}. In contrast to these work, this study aims to examine the fidelity of GPT-4's comprehension of classic trading theories and its proficiency in applying its code interpreter abilities to real-world trading data analysis. Such an exploration is instrumental in discerning whether the underlying logic GPT-4 employs for trading is intrinsically reliable. Furthermore, given the acknowledged interpretative latitude inherent in most trading theories, we seek to distill more precise methodologies of deploying these theories from GPT-4's analytical process, potentially offering invaluable insights to human traders.   To achieve this objective, we selected daily candlestick (K-line) data from specific periods for certain assets, such as the Shanghai Stock Index. Through meticulous prompt engineering, we guided GPT-4 to analyze the technical structures embedded within this data, based on specific theories like the Elliott Wave Theory. We then subjected its analytical output to manual evaluation, assessing its interpretative depth and accuracy vis-\`a-vis these trading theories from multiple dimensions. The results and findings from this study could pave the way for a synergistic amalgamation of human expertise and AI-driven insights in the realm of trading.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10982v1
Conformal Temporal Logic Planning using Large Language Models,"Jun Wang, Jiaming Tong, Kaiyuan Tan, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Yiannis Kantaros",2023-09-18,"This paper addresses a new motion planning problem for mobile robots tasked with accomplishing multiple high-level sub-tasks, expressed using natural language (NL). These sub-tasks should be accomplished in a temporal and logical order. To formally define the overarching mission, we leverage Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) defined over atomic predicates modeling these NL-based sub-tasks. This is in contrast to related planning approaches that define LTL tasks over atomic predicates capturing desired low-level system configurations. Our goal is to design robot plans that satisfy LTL tasks defined over NL-based atomic propositions. A novel technical challenge arising in this setup lies in reasoning about correctness of a robot plan with respect to such LTL-encoded tasks. To address this problem, we propose HERACLEs, a hierarchical conformal natural language planner, that relies on (i) automata theory to determine what NL-specified sub-tasks should be accomplished next to make mission progress; (ii) Large Language Models to design robot plans satisfying these sub-tasks; and (iii) conformal prediction to reason probabilistically about correctness of the designed plans and to determine if external assistance is required.

Consequently, these models are now well-positioned to reason about the physical world, particularly within domains such as robotic manipulation. However, current VLMs are limited in their understanding of the physical concepts (e.g., material, fragility) of common objects, which restricts their usefulness for robotic manipulation tasks that involve interaction and physical reasoning about such objects. To address this limitation, we propose PhysObjects, an object-centric dataset of 39.6K crowd-sourced and 417K automated physical concept annotations of common household objects. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a VLM on PhysObjects improves its understanding of physical object concepts, including generalization to held-out concepts, by capturing human priors of these concepts from visual appearance. We incorporate this physically grounded VLM in an interactive framework with a large language model-based robotic planner, and show improved planning performance on tasks that require reasoning about physical object concepts, compared to baselines that do not leverage physically grounded VLMs. We additionally illustrate the benefits of our physically grounded VLM on a real robot, where it improves task success rates.

Self-driven Grounding: Large Language Model Agents with Automatical Language-aligned Skill Learning,"Shaohui Peng, Xing Hu, Qi Yi, Rui Zhang, Jiaming Guo, Di Huang, Zikang Tian, Ruizhi Chen, Zidong Du, Qi Guo, Yunji Chen, Ling Li",2023-09-04,"Large language models (LLMs) show their powerful automatic reasoning and planning capability with a wealth of semantic knowledge about the human world. However, the grounding problem still hinders the applications of LLMs in the real-world environment. Existing studies try to fine-tune the LLM or utilize pre-defined behavior APIs to bridge the LLMs and the environment, which not only costs huge human efforts to customize for every single task but also weakens the generality strengths of LLMs. To autonomously ground the LLM onto the environment, we proposed the Self-Driven Grounding (SDG) framework to automatically and progressively ground the LLM with self-driven skill learning. SDG first employs the LLM to propose the hypothesis of sub-goals to achieve tasks and then verify the feasibility of the hypothesis via interacting with the underlying environment. Once verified, SDG can then learn generalized skills with the guidance of these successfully grounded subgoals. These skills can be further utilized to accomplish more complex tasks which fail to pass the verification phase. Verified in the famous instruction following task set-BabyAI, SDG achieves comparable performance in the most challenging tasks compared with imitation learning methods that cost millions of demonstrations, proving the effectiveness of learned skills and showing the feasibility and efficiency of our framework.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01352v1
Recommender AI Agent: Integrating Large Language Models for Interactive Recommendations,"Xu Huang, Jianxun Lian, Yuxuan Lei, Jing Yao, Defu Lian, Xing Xie",2023-08-31,"Recommender models excel at providing domain-specific item recommendations by leveraging extensive user behavior data. Despite their ability to act as lightweight domain experts, they struggle to perform versatile tasks such as providing explanations and engaging in conversations. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) represent a significant step towards artificial general intelligence, showcasing remarkable capabilities in instruction comprehension, commonsense reasoning, and human interaction. However, LLMs lack the knowledge of domain-specific item catalogs and behavioral patterns, particularly in areas that diverge from general world knowledge, such as online e-commerce. Finetuning LLMs for each domain is neither economic nor efficient.   In this paper, we bridge the gap between recommender models and LLMs, combining their respective strengths to create a versatile and interactive recommender system. We introduce an efficient framework called \textbf{InteRecAgent}, which employs LLMs as the brain and recommender models as tools. We first outline a minimal set of essential tools required to transform LLMs into InteRecAgent. We then propose an efficient workflow within InteRecAgent for task execution, incorporating key components such as memory components, dynamic demonstration-augmented task planning, and reflection. InteRecAgent enables traditional recommender systems, such as those ID-based matrix factorization models, to become interactive systems with a natural language interface through the integration of LLMs. Experimental results on several public datasets show that InteRecAgent achieves satisfying performance as a conversational recommender system, outperforming general-purpose LLMs. The source code of InteRecAgent is released at https://aka.ms/recagent.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16505v3
Interactively Robot Action Planning with Uncertainty Analysis and Active Questioning by Large Language Model,"Kazuki Hori, Kanata Suzuki, Tetsuya Ogata",2023-08-30,"The application of the Large Language Model (LLM) to robot action planning has been actively studied. The instructions given to the LLM by natural language may include ambiguity and lack of information depending on the task context. It is possible to adjust the output of LLM by making the instruction input more detailed; however, the design cost is high. In this paper, we propose the interactive robot action planning method that allows the LLM to analyze and gather missing information by asking questions to humans. The method can minimize the design cost of generating precise robot instructions. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method through concrete examples in cooking tasks. However, our experiments also revealed challenges in robot action planning with LLM, such as asking unimportant questions and assuming crucial information without asking.

Large Language Models as Human Mobility Predictors,"Xinglei Wang, Meng Fang, Zichao Zeng, Tao Cheng",2023-08-29,"Accurate human mobility prediction underpins many important applications across a variety of domains, including epidemic modelling, transport planning, and emergency responses. Due to the sparsity of mobility data and the stochastic nature of people's daily activities, achieving precise predictions of people's locations remains a challenge. While recently developed large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance across numerous language-related tasks, their applicability to human mobility studies remains unexplored. Addressing this gap, this article delves into the potential of LLMs for human mobility prediction tasks. We introduce a novel method, LLM-Mob, which leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs for analysing human mobility data. We present concepts of historical stays and context stays to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in human movement and enable time-aware prediction by using time information of the prediction target. Additionally, we design context-inclusive prompts that enable LLMs to generate more accurate predictions.

Thus, we designed an LLM-powered autonomous recommender agent, RecMind, which is capable of leveraging external knowledge, utilizing tools with careful planning to provide zero-shot personalized recommendations. We propose a Self-Inspiring algorithm to improve the planning ability. At each intermediate step, the LLM self-inspires to consider all previously explored states to plan for the next step. This mechanism greatly improves the model's ability to comprehend and utilize historical information in planning for recommendation.

Planning with Logical Graph-based Language Model for Instruction Generation,"Fan Zhang, Kebing Jin, Hankz Hankui Zhuo",2023-08-26,"Despite the superior performance of large language models to generate natural language texts, it is hard to generate texts with correct logic according to a given task, due to the difficulties for neural models to capture implied rules from free-form texts. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based language model, Logical-GLM, to infuse logic into language models for more valid text generation and interpretability. Specifically, we first capture information from natural language instructions and construct logical bayes graphs that generally describe domains. Next, we generate logical skeletons to guide language model training, infusing domain knowledge into language models. Finally, we alternately optimize the searching policy of graphs and language models until convergence. The experimental results show that Logical-GLM is both effective and efficient compared with traditional language models, despite using smaller-scale training data and fewer parameters.

LLMs are advantageous in offering the potential to enhance the generalizability as task-agnostic planners and facilitate flexible interaction between human instructors and planning systems. However, task plans generated by LLMs often lack feasibility and correctness. To address this challenge, we introduce ISR-LLM, a novel framework that improves LLM-based planning through an iterative self-refinement process. The framework operates through three sequential steps: preprocessing, planning, and iterative self-refinement. During preprocessing, an LLM translator is employed to convert natural language input into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) formulation. In the planning phase, an LLM planner formulates an initial plan, which is then assessed and refined in the iterative self-refinement step by using a validator. We examine the performance of ISR-LLM across three distinct planning domains. The results show that ISR-LLM is able to achieve markedly higher success rates in task accomplishments compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planners. Moreover, it also preserves the broad applicability and generalizability of working with natural language instructions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13724v1
SayCanPay: Heuristic Planning with Large Language Models using Learnable Domain Knowledge,"Rishi Hazra, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires, Luc De Raedt",2023-08-24,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive planning abilities due to their vast ""world knowledge"". Yet, obtaining plans that are both feasible (grounded in affordances) and cost-effective (in plan length), remains a challenge, despite recent progress. This contrasts with heuristic planning methods that employ domain knowledge (formalized in action models such as PDDL) and heuristic search to generate feasible, optimal plans. Inspired by this, we propose to combine the power of LLMs and heuristic planning by leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs and the principles of heuristic search. Our approach, SayCanPay, employs LLMs to generate actions (Say) guided by learnable domain knowledge, that evaluates actions' feasibility (Can) and long-term reward/payoff (Pay), and heuristic search to select the best sequence of actions.

Analyzing Transformer Dynamics as Movement through Embedding Space,Sumeet S. Singh,2023-08-21,"Transformer based language models exhibit intelligent behaviors such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, acquiring knowledge, reasoning, planning, reflecting and using tools. This paper explores how their underlying mechanics give rise to intelligent behaviors. Towards that end, we propose framing Transformer dynamics as movement through embedding space. Examining Transformers through this perspective reveals key insights, establishing a Theory of Transformers: 1) Intelligent behaviours map to paths in Embedding Space which, the Transformer random-walks through during inferencing. 2) LM training learns a probability distribution over all possible paths. `Intelligence' is learnt by assigning higher probabilities to paths representing intelligent behaviors. No learning can take place in-context; context only narrows the subset of paths sampled during decoding. 5) The Transformer is a self-mapping composition function, folding a context sequence into a context-vector such that it's proximity to a token-vector reflects its co-occurrence and conditioned probability. Thus, the physical arrangement of vectors in Embedding Space determines path probabilities. 6) Context vectors are composed by aggregating features of the sequence's tokens via a process we call the encoding walk. Attention contributes a - potentially redundant - association-bias to this process. 7) This process is comprised of two principal operation types: filtering (data independent) and aggregation (data dependent). This generalization unifies Transformers with other sequence models. Building upon this foundation, we formalize a popular semantic interpretation of embeddings into a ``concept-space theory'' and find some evidence of it's validity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10874v2

This paradigm, known as LLM-based planning, provides flexibility in problem solving and endows better interpretability. However, current research is mostly limited to basic scenarios of simple questions that can be straightforward answered in a few inference steps. Planning for the more challenging multi-hop visual reasoning tasks remains under-explored. Specifically, under multi-hop reasoning situations, the trade-off between accuracy and the complexity of plan-searching becomes prominent. The prevailing algorithms either address the efficiency issue by employing the fast one-stop generation or adopt a complex iterative generation method to improve accuracy. Both fail to balance the need for efficiency and performance. Drawing inspiration from the dual system of cognition in the human brain, the fast and the slow think processes, we propose a hierarchical plan-searching algorithm that integrates the one-stop reasoning (fast) and the Tree-of-thought (slow). Our approach succeeds in performance while significantly saving inference steps. Moreover, we repurpose the PTR and the CLEVER datasets, developing a systematic framework for evaluating the performance and efficiency of LLMs-based plan-search algorithms under reasoning tasks at different levels of difficulty.

Introducing auxiliary information via text with human-in-the-loop prompting during inference opens up unique opportunities, such as open vocabulary segmentation and potentially more robust segmentation models against out-of-distribution data. Although transfer learning from natural to medical images has been explored for image-only segmentation models, the joint representation of vision-language in segmentation problems remains underexplored. This study introduces the first systematic study on transferring VLSMs to 2D medical images, using carefully curated $11$ datasets encompassing diverse modalities and insightful language prompts and experiments. Our findings demonstrate that although VLSMs show competitive performance compared to image-only models for segmentation after finetuning in limited medical image datasets, not all VLSMs utilize the additional information from language prompts, with image features playing a dominant role. While VLSMs exhibit enhanced performance in handling pooled datasets with diverse modalities and show potential robustness to domain shifts compared to conventional segmentation models, our results suggest that novel approaches are required to enable VLSMs to leverage the various auxiliary information available through language prompts.

Bootstrapping Developmental AIs: From Simple Competences to Intelligent Human-Compatible AIs,"Mark Stefik, Robert Price",2023-08-08,"Developmental AI creates embodied AIs that develop human-like abilities. The AIs start with innate competences and learn more by interacting with the world including people. Developmental AIs have been demonstrated, but their abilities so far do not surpass those of pre-toddler children. In contrast, mainstream approaches have led to impressive feats and commercially valuable AI systems. The approaches include deep learning and generative AI (e.g., large language models) and manually constructed symbolic modeling. However, manually constructed AIs tend to be brittle even in circumscribed domains. Generative AIs are helpful on average, but they can make strange mistakes and not notice them. Not learning from their experience in the world, they can lack common sense and social alignment. This position paper lays out prospects, gaps, and challenges for a bootstrapping approach to developmental AI that follows a bio-inspired trajectory. The approach creates experiential foundation models for human-compatible AIs. A virtuous multidisciplinary research cycle has led to developmental AIs with capabilities for multimodal perception, object recognition, and manipulation. Computational models for hierarchical planning, abstraction discovery, curiosity, and language acquisition exist but need to be adapted to an embodied learning approach.

New Interaction Paradigm for Complex EDA Software Leveraging GPT,"Boyu Han, Xinyu Wang, Yifan Wang, Junyu Yan, Yidong Tian",2023-07-27,"In the rapidly growing field of electronic design automation (EDA), professional software such as KiCad, Cadence , and Altium Designer provide increasingly extensive design functionalities. However, the intricate command structure and high learning curve create a barrier, particularly for novice printed circuit board (PCB) designers. This results in difficulties in selecting appropriate functions or plugins for varying design purposes, compounded by the lack of intuitive learning methods beyond traditional documentation, videos, and online forums. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence (AI) interaction assist plugin for EDA software named SmartonAl is developed here, also KiCad is taken as the first example. SmartonAI is inspired by the HuggingGPT framework and employs large language models, such as GPT and BERT, to facilitate task planning and execution. On receiving a designer request, SmartonAI conducts a task breakdown and efficiently executes relevant subtasks, such as analysis of help documentation paragraphs and execution of different plugins, along with leveraging the built-in schematic and PCB manipulation functions in both SmartonAl itself and software. Our preliminary results demonstrate that SmartonAI can significantly streamline the PCB design process by simplifying complex commands into intuitive language-based interactions. By harnessing the powerful language capabilities of ChatGPT and the rich design functions of KiCad, the plugin effectively bridges the gap between complex EDA software and user-friendly interaction. Meanwhile, the new paradigm behind SmartonAI can also extend to other complex software systems, illustrating the immense potential of AI-assisted user interfaces in advancing digital interactions across various domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14740v1
DPBERT: Efficient Inference for BERT based on Dynamic Planning,"Weixin Wu, Hankz Hankui Zhuo",2023-07-26,"Large-scale pre-trained language models such as BERT have contributed significantly to the development of NLP. However, those models require large computational resources, making it difficult to be applied to mobile devices where computing power is limited. In this paper we aim to address the weakness of existing input-adaptive inference methods which fail to take full advantage of the structure of BERT. We propose Dynamic Planning in BERT, a novel fine-tuning strategy that can accelerate the inference process of BERT through selecting a subsequence of transformer layers list of backbone as a computational path for an input sample. To do this, our approach adds a planning module to the original BERT model to determine whether a layer is included or bypassed during inference. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark exhibit that our method reduces latency to 75\% while maintaining 98\% accuracy, yielding a better accuracy-speed trade-off compared to state-of-the-art input-adaptive methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00108v1

For the latter, we implemented a closed-feedback loop between LLM-generated low-level actions with a vulnerable virtual machine (connected through SSH) and allowed the LLM to analyze the machine state for vulnerabilities and suggest concrete attack vectors which were automatically executed within the virtual machine.

COLLIE: Systematic Construction of Constrained Text Generation Tasks,"Shunyu Yao, Howard Chen, Austin W. Hanjie, Runzhe Yang, Karthik Narasimhan",2023-07-17,"Text generation under constraints have seen increasing interests in natural language processing, especially with the rapidly improving capabilities of large language models.

We present COLLIE, a grammar-based framework that allows the specification of rich, compositional constraints with diverse generation levels (word, sentence, paragraph, passage) and modeling challenges (e.g.,language understanding, logical reasoning, counting, semantic planning). We also develop tools for automatic extraction of task instances given a constraint structure and a raw text corpus. Using COLLIE, we compile the COLLIE-v1 dataset with 2080 instances comprising 13 constraint structures.

GeoGPT: Understanding and Processing Geospatial Tasks through An Autonomous GPT,"Yifan Zhang, Cheng Wei, Shangyou Wu, Zhengting He, Wenhao Yu",2023-07-16,"Decision-makers in GIS need to combine a series of spatial algorithms and operations to solve geospatial tasks. For example, in the task of facility siting, the Buffer tool is usually first used to locate areas close or away from some specific entities; then, the Intersect or Erase tool is used to select candidate areas satisfied multiple requirements. Though professionals can easily understand and solve these geospatial tasks by sequentially utilizing relevant tools, it is difficult for non-professionals to handle these problems. Recently, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (e.g., ChatGPT) presents strong performance in semantic understanding and reasoning. Especially, AutoGPT can further extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by automatically reasoning and calling externally defined tools. Inspired by these studies, we attempt to lower the threshold of non-professional users to solve geospatial tasks by integrating the semantic understanding ability inherent in LLMs with mature tools within the GIS community. Specifically, we develop a new framework called GeoGPT that can conduct geospatial data collection, processing, and analysis in an autonomous manner with the instruction of only natural language. In other words, GeoGPT is used to understand the demands of non-professional users merely based on input natural language descriptions, and then think, plan, and execute defined GIS tools to output final effective results. Several cases including geospatial data crawling, spatial query, facility siting, and mapping validate the effectiveness of our framework. Though limited cases are presented in this paper, GeoGPT can be further extended to various tasks by equipping with more GIS tools, and we think the paradigm of ""foundational plus professional"" implied in GeoGPT provides an effective way to develop next-generation GIS in this era of large foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07930v1
Coupling Large Language Models with Logic Programming for Robust and General Reasoning from Text,"Zhun Yang, Adam Ishay, Joohyung Lee",2023-07-15,"While large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3, appear to be robust and general, their reasoning ability is not at a level to compete with the best models trained for specific natural language reasoning problems.

It can convert natural language sentences into a logical form that serves as input for answer set programs, a logic-based declarative knowledge representation formalism. The combination results in a robust and general system that can handle multiple question-answering tasks without requiring retraining for each new task. It only needs a few examples to guide the LLM's adaptation to a specific task, along with reusable ASP knowledge modules that can be applied to multiple tasks.

Self-Adaptive Large Language Model (LLM)-Based Multiagent Systems,"Nathalia Nascimento, Paulo Alencar, Donald Cowan",2023-07-12,"In autonomic computing, self-adaptation has been proposed as a fundamental paradigm to manage the complexity of multiagent systems (MASs).

To ensure the scalability of our approach, we: (1) exploit the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs to allow LLMs to conduct a 'semantic search' for task-relevant subgraphs from a smaller, collapsed representation of the full graph; (2) reduce the planning horizon for the LLM by integrating a classical path planner and (3) introduce an 'iterative replanning' pipeline that refines the initial plan using feedback from a scene graph simulator, correcting infeasible actions and avoiding planning failures. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale environments spanning up to 3 floors and 36 rooms with 140 assets and objects and show that our approach is capable of grounding large-scale, long-horizon task plans from abstract, and natural language instruction for a mobile manipulator robot to execute.

Despite the progress, most still rely on pre-defined motion primitives to carry out the physical interactions with the environment, which remains a major bottleneck. In this work, we aim to synthesize robot trajectories, i.e., a dense sequence of 6-DoF end-effector waypoints, for a large variety of manipulation tasks given an open-set of instructions and an open-set of objects. We achieve this by first observing that LLMs excel at inferring affordances and constraints given a free-form language instruction. More importantly, by leveraging their code-writing capabilities, they can interact with a vision-language model (VLM) to compose 3D value maps to ground the knowledge into the observation space of the agent. The composed value maps are then used in a model-based planning framework to zero-shot synthesize closed-loop robot trajectories with robustness to dynamic perturbations. We further demonstrate how the proposed framework can benefit from online experiences by efficiently learning a dynamics model for scenes that involve contact-rich interactions.

Deductive Additivity for Planning of Natural Language Proofs,"Zayne Sprague, Kaj Bostrom, Swarat Chaudhuri, Greg Durrett",2023-07-05,"Current natural language systems designed for multi-step claim validation typically operate in two phases: retrieve a set of relevant premise statements using heuristics (planning), then generate novel conclusions from those statements using a large language model (deduction). The planning step often requires expensive Transformer operations and does not scale to arbitrary numbers of premise statements. In this paper, we investigate whether an efficient planning heuristic is possible via embedding spaces compatible with deductive reasoning. Specifically, we evaluate whether embedding spaces exhibit a property we call deductive additivity: the sum of premise statement embeddings should be close to embeddings of conclusions based on those premises. We explore multiple sources of off-the-shelf dense embeddings in addition to fine-tuned embeddings from GPT3 and sparse embeddings from BM25. We study embedding models both intrinsically, evaluating whether the property of deductive additivity holds, and extrinsically, using them to assist planning in natural language proof generation.

In particular, how do humans make meaning from language--and how can we leverage a theory of linguistic meaning to build machines that think in more human-like ways? In this paper, we propose rational meaning construction, a computational framework for language-informed thinking that combines neural language models with probabilistic models for rational inference. We frame linguistic meaning as a context-sensitive mapping from natural language into a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT)--a general-purpose symbolic substrate for generative world modeling. Our architecture integrates two computational tools that have not previously come together: we model thinking with probabilistic programs, an expressive representation for commonsense reasoning; and we model meaning construction with large language models (LLMs), which support broad-coverage translation from natural language utterances to code expressions in a probabilistic programming language. We illustrate our framework through examples covering four core domains from cognitive science: probabilistic reasoning, logical and relational reasoning, visual and physical reasoning, and social reasoning. In each, we show that LLMs can generate context-sensitive translations that capture pragmatically-appropriate linguistic meanings, while Bayesian inference with the generated programs supports coherent and robust commonsense reasoning. We extend our framework to integrate cognitively-motivated symbolic modules (physics simulators, graphics engines, and planning algorithms) to provide a unified commonsense thinking interface from language. Finally, we explore how language can drive the construction of world models themselves. We hope this work will provide a roadmap towards cognitive models and AI systems that synthesize the insights of both modern and classical computational perspectives.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12672v2
CorNav: Autonomous Agent with Self-Corrected Planning for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation,"Xiwen Liang, Liang Ma, Shanshan Guo, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Shikui Ma, Xiaodan Liang",2023-06-17,"Understanding and following natural language instructions while navigating through complex, real-world environments poses a significant challenge for general-purpose robots. These environments often include obstacles and pedestrians, making it essential for autonomous agents to possess the capability of self-corrected planning to adjust their actions based on feedback from the surroundings. However, the majority of existing vision-and-language navigation (VLN) methods primarily operate in less realistic simulator settings and do not incorporate environmental feedback into their decision-making processes. To address this gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot framework called CorNav, utilizing a large language model for decision-making and comprising two key components: 1) incorporating environmental feedback for refining future plans and adjusting its actions, and 2) multiple domain experts for parsing instructions, scene understanding, and refining predicted actions. In addition to the framework, we develop a 3D simulator that renders realistic scenarios using Unreal Engine 5. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of navigation agents in a zero-shot multi-task setting, we create a benchmark called NavBench. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CorNav consistently outperforms all baselines by a significant margin across all tasks. On average, CorNav achieves a success rate of 28.1\%, surpassing the best baseline's performance of 20.5\%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10322v3
Synapse: Trajectory-as-Exemplar Prompting with Memory for Computer Control,"Longtao Zheng, Rundong Wang, Xinrun Wang, Bo An",2023-06-13,"Building agents with large language models (LLMs) for computer control is a burgeoning research area, where the agent receives computer states and performs actions to complete complex tasks. Previous computer agents have demonstrated the benefits of in-context learning (ICL); however, their performance is hindered by several issues. First, the limited context length of LLMs and complex computer states restrict the number of exemplars, as a single webpage can consume the entire context. Second, the exemplars in current methods, such as high-level plans and multi-choice questions, cannot represent complete trajectories, leading to suboptimal performance in long-horizon tasks. Third, existing computer agents rely on task-specific exemplars and overlook the similarity among tasks, resulting in poor generalization to novel tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Synapse, a computer agent featuring three key components: i) state abstraction, which filters out task-irrelevant information from raw states, allowing more exemplars within the limited context, ii) trajectory-as-exemplar prompting, which prompts the LLM with complete trajectories of the abstracted states and actions to improve multi-step decision-making, and iii) exemplar memory, which stores the embeddings of exemplars and retrieves them via similarity search for generalization to novel tasks. We evaluate Synapse on MiniWoB++, a standard task suite, and Mind2Web, a real-world website benchmark. In MiniWoB++, Synapse achieves a 99.2% average success rate (a 10% relative improvement) across 64 tasks using demonstrations from only 48 tasks. Notably, Synapse is the first ICL method to solve the book-flight task in MiniWoB++. Synapse also exhibits a 56% relative improvement in average step success rate over the previous state-of-the-art prompting scheme in Mind2Web.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07863v3

For interactive vision-language tasks involving intricate visual scenes, a large quantity of diverse and creative instruction-response pairs should be imperative to tune vision-language models (VLMs). Nevertheless, the current availability of vision-language instruction-response pairs in terms of quantity, diversity, and creativity remains limited, posing challenges to the generalization of interactive VLMs. Here we present MultI-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning (MIMIC-IT), a dataset comprising 2.8 million multimodal instruction-response pairs, with 2.2 million unique instructions derived from images and videos. Each pair is accompanied by multi-modal in-context information, forming conversational contexts aimed at empowering VLMs in perception, reasoning, and planning. The instruction-response collection process, dubbed as Syphus, is scaled using an automatic annotation pipeline that combines human expertise with GPT's capabilities. Using the MIMIC-IT dataset, we train a large VLM named Otter. Based on extensive evaluations conducted on vision-language benchmarks, it has been observed that Otter demonstrates remarkable proficiency in multi-modal perception, reasoning, and in-context learning. Human evaluation reveals it effectively aligns with the user's intentions.

Robot Task Planning Based on Large Language Model Representing Knowledge with Directed Graph Structures,"Yue Zhen, Sheng Bi, Lu Xing-tong, Pan Wei-qin, Shi Hai-peng, Chen Zi-rui, Fang Yi-shu",2023-06-08,"Traditional robot task planning methods face challenges when dealing with highly unstructured environments and complex tasks. We propose a task planning method that combines human expertise with an LLM and have designed an LLM prompt template, Think_Net_Prompt, with stronger expressive power to represent structured professional knowledge. We further propose a method to progressively decompose tasks and generate a task tree to reduce the planning volume for each task, and we have designed a strategy to decouple robot task planning. By dividing different planning entities and separating the task from the actual machine binding process, the task planning process becomes more flexible. Research results show that our method performs well in handling specified code formats, understanding the relationship between tasks and subtasks, and extracting parameters from text descriptions. However, there are also problems such as limited complexity of task logic handling, ambiguity in the quantity of parts and the precise location of assembly. Improving the precision of task description and cognitive structure can bring certain improvements. https://github.com/NOMIzy/Think_Net_Prompt",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05171v1
Enabling Intelligent Interactions between an Agent and an LLM: A Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Bin Hu, Chenyang Zhao, Pu Zhang, Zihao Zhou, Yuanhang Yang, Zenglin Xu, Bin Liu",2023-06-06,"Large language models (LLMs) encode a vast amount of world knowledge acquired from massive text datasets. Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs can assist an embodied agent in solving complex sequential decision making tasks by providing high-level instructions. However, interactions with LLMs can be time-consuming. In many practical scenarios, it requires a significant amount of storage space that can only be deployed on remote cloud servers. Additionally, using commercial LLMs can be costly since they may charge based on usage frequency. In this paper, we explore how to enable intelligent cost-effective interactions between a down stream task oriented agent and an LLM. We find that this problem can be naturally formulated by a Markov decision process (MDP), and propose When2Ask, a reinforcement learning based approach that learns when it is necessary to query LLMs for high-level instructions to accomplish a target task. On one side, When2Ask discourages unnecessary redundant interactions, while on the other side, it enables the agent to identify and follow useful instructions from the LLM. This enables the agent to halt an ongoing plan and transition to a more suitable one based on new environmental observations. Experiments on MiniGrid and Habitat environments that entail planning sub-goals demonstrate that When2Ask learns to solve target tasks with only a few necessary interactions with the LLM, significantly reducing interaction costs in testing environments compared with baseline methods.

AutoScrum: Automating Project Planning Using Large Language Models,Martin Schroder,2023-06-05,"Recent advancements in the field of large language models have made it possible to use language models for advanced reasoning. In this paper we leverage this ability for designing complex project plans based only on knowing the current state and the desired state. Two approaches are demonstrated - a scrum based approach and a shortcut plan approach. The scrum based approach executes an automated process of requirements gathering, user story mapping, feature identification, task decomposition and finally generates questions and search terms for seeking out domain specific information to assist with task completion. The shortcut approach looks at most recent snapshot of the current and desired state and generates the next most reasonable task to do in order to get to the desired state as quickly as possible. In this paper we automate everything using a novel concept of ""Language Programs"". These are programs written in natural language designed to process input data through the language model. Guidance language is used for all LLM programs. All demo source code for this paper is available at https://github.com/autoscrum/autoscrum",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03197v1
Improving Generalization in Task-oriented Dialogues with Workflows and Action Plans,"Stefania Raimondo, Christopher Pal, Xiaotian Liu, David Vazquez, Hector Palacios",2023-06-02,"Task-oriented dialogue is difficult in part because it involves understanding user intent, collecting information from the user, executing API calls, and generating helpful and fluent responses. However, for complex tasks one must also correctly do all of these things over multiple steps, and in a specific order. While large pre-trained language models can be fine-tuned end-to-end to create multi-step task-oriented dialogue agents that generate fluent text, our experiments confirm that this approach alone cannot reliably perform new multi-step tasks that are unseen during training. To address these limitations, we augment the dialogue contexts given to \textmd{text2text} transformers with known \textit{valid workflow names} and \textit{action plans}. Action plans consist of sequences of actions required to accomplish a task, and are encoded as simple sequences of keywords (e.g. verify-identity, pull-up-account, reset-password, etc.). We perform extensive experiments on the Action-Based Conversations Dataset (ABCD) with T5-small, base and large models, and show that such models: a) are able to more readily generalize to unseen workflows by following the provided plan, and b) are able to generalize to executing unseen actions if they are provided in the plan. In contrast, models are unable to fully accomplish new multi-step tasks when they are not provided action plan information, even when given new valid workflow names.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01729v1
Interpretable Math Word Problem Solution Generation Via Step-by-step Planning,"Mengxue Zhang, Zichao Wang, Zhichao Yang, Weiqi Feng, Andrew Lan",2023-06-01,"Solutions to math word problems (MWPs) with step-by-step explanations are valuable, especially in education, to help students better comprehend problem-solving strategies. Most existing approaches only focus on obtaining the final correct answer. A few recent approaches leverage intermediate solution steps to improve final answer correctness but often cannot generate coherent steps with a clear solution strategy. Contrary to existing work, we focus on improving the correctness and coherence of the intermediate solutions steps. We propose a step-by-step planning approach for intermediate solution generation, which strategically plans the generation of the next solution step based on the MWP and the previous solution steps. Our approach first plans the next step by predicting the necessary math operation needed to proceed, given history steps, then generates the next step, token-by-token, by prompting a language model with the predicted math operation. Experiments on the GSM8K dataset demonstrate that our approach improves the accuracy and interpretability of the solution on both automatic metrics and human evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00784v1
Decision-Oriented Dialogue for Human-AI Collaboration,"Jessy Lin, Nicholas Tomlin, Jacob Andreas, Jason Eisner",2023-05-31,"We describe a class of tasks called decision-oriented dialogues, in which AI assistants such as large language models (LMs) must collaborate with one or more humans via natural language to help them make complex decisions. We formalize three domains in which users face everyday decisions: (1) choosing an assignment of reviewers to conference papers, (2) planning a multi-step itinerary in a city, and (3) negotiating travel plans for a group of friends. In each of these settings, AI assistants and users have disparate abilities that they must combine to arrive at the best decision: assistants can access and process large amounts of information, while users have preferences and constraints external to the system. For each task, we build a dialogue environment where agents receive a reward based on the quality of the final decision they reach. We evaluate LMs in self-play and in collaboration with humans and find that they fall short compared to human assistants, achieving much lower rewards despite engaging in longer dialogues. We highlight a number of challenges models face in decision-oriented dialogues, ranging from goal-directed behavior to reasoning and optimization, and release our environments as a testbed for future work.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20076v3
Speaking the Language of Your Listener: Audience-Aware Adaptation via Plug-and-Play Theory of Mind,"Ece Takmaz, Nicolo' Brandizzi, Mario Giulianelli, Sandro Pezzelle, Raquel Fernández",2023-05-31,"Dialogue participants may have varying levels of knowledge about the topic under discussion. In such cases, it is essential for speakers to adapt their utterances by taking their audience into account. Yet, it is an open question how such adaptation can be modelled in computational agents. In this paper, we model a visually grounded referential game between a knowledgeable speaker and a listener with more limited visual and linguistic experience. Inspired by psycholinguistic theories, we endow our speaker with the ability to adapt its referring expressions via a simulation module that monitors the effectiveness of planned utterances from the listener's perspective. We propose an adaptation mechanism building on plug-and-play approaches to controlled language generation, where utterance generation is steered on the fly by the simulator without finetuning the speaker's underlying language model. Our results and analyses show that our approach is effective: the speaker's utterances become closer to the listener's domain of expertise, which leads to higher communicative success.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19933v1

Grammar Prompting for Domain-Specific Language Generation with Large Language Models,"Bailin Wang, Zi Wang, Xuezhi Wang, Yuan Cao, Rif A. Saurous, Yoon Kim",2023-05-30,"Large language models (LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of natural language tasks from just a handful of in-context examples. However, for generating strings from highly structured languages (e.g., semantic parsing to complex domain-specific languages), it is challenging for the LLM to generalize from just a few exemplars. We propose \emph{grammar prompting}, a simple approach to enable LLMs to use external knowledge and domain-specific constraints, expressed through a grammar in Backus--Naur Form (BNF), during in-context learning. Grammar prompting augments each demonstration example with a specialized grammar that is minimally sufficient for generating the particular output example, where the specialized grammar is a subset of the full DSL grammar. For inference, the LLM first predicts a BNF grammar given a test input, and then generates the output according to the rules of the grammar. Experiments demonstrate that grammar prompting can enable LLMs to perform competitively on a diverse set of DSL generation tasks, including semantic parsing (SMCalFlow, Overnight, GeoQuery), PDDL planning, and SMILES-based molecule generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19234v3
AlphaBlock: Embodied Finetuning for Vision-Language Reasoning in Robot Manipulation,"Chuhao Jin, Wenhui Tan, Jiange Yang, Bei Liu, Ruihua Song, Limin Wang, Jianlong Fu",2023-05-30,"We propose a novel framework for learning high-level cognitive capabilities in robot manipulation tasks, such as making a smiley face using building blocks. These tasks often involve complex multi-step reasoning, presenting significant challenges due to the limited paired data connecting human instructions (e.g., making a smiley face) and robot actions (e.g., end-effector movement). Existing approaches relieve this challenge by adopting an open-loop paradigm decomposing high-level instructions into simple sub-task plans, and executing them step-by-step using low-level control models. However, these approaches are short of instant observations in multi-step reasoning, leading to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose to automatically collect a cognitive robot dataset by Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting dataset AlphaBlock consists of 35 comprehensive high-level tasks of multi-step text plans and paired observation sequences. To enable efficient data acquisition, we employ elaborated multi-round prompt designs that effectively reduce the burden of extensive human involvement. We further propose a closed-loop multi-modal embodied planning model that autoregressively generates plans by taking image observations as input. To facilitate effective learning, we leverage MiniGPT-4 with a frozen visual encoder and LLM, and finetune additional vision adapter and Q-former to enable fine-grained spatial perception for manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments to verify the superiority over existing open and closed-loop methods, and achieve a significant increase in success rate by 21.4% and 14.5% over ChatGPT and GPT-4 based robot tasks.

Integrating Action Knowledge and LLMs for Task Planning and Situation Handling in Open Worlds,"Yan Ding, Xiaohan Zhang, Saeid Amiri, Nieqing Cao, Hao Yang, Andy Kaminski, Chad Esselink, Shiqi Zhang",2023-05-27,"Task planning systems have been developed to help robots use human knowledge (about actions) to complete long-horizon tasks. Most of them have been developed for ""closed worlds"" while assuming the robot is provided with complete world knowledge. However, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break the planner's completeness. Could we leverage the recent advances on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable classical planning systems to deal with novel situations?   This paper introduces a novel framework, called COWP, for open-world task planning and situation handling. COWP dynamically augments the robot's action knowledge, including the preconditions and effects of actions, with task-oriented commonsense knowledge. COWP embraces the openness from LLMs, and is grounded to specific domains via action knowledge. For systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 1,085 execution-time situations. Each situation corresponds to a state instance wherein a robot is potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks.

However, recent studies, have found that their ability to plan remains questionable. Through our experiments using GPT-2, we empirically demonstrate that the performance of a finetuned baseline remains poor because it violates pre-conditions of actions in the plans that it generates. To improve the planning capabilities of a finetuned LLM, we train a verifier, which can classify actions as being valid or invalid in a particular state. By randomly sampling actions from the same dataset, we generate examples of invalid actions which are then used to train a verifier which can check for action applicability. In the presence of diverse sampling from a generator and a verifier which can prune invalid trajectories, we show significant gains in the success rate on the Blocksworld domain. Additionally, we show that finetuning the GPT-2 generator itself to create the verifier generalizes better than finetuning the base GPT-2.

At each step, NavGPT takes the textual descriptions of visual observations, navigation history, and future explorable directions as inputs to reason the agent's current status, and makes the decision to approach the target. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate NavGPT can explicitly perform high-level planning for navigation, including decomposing instruction into sub-goal, integrating commonsense knowledge relevant to navigation task resolution, identifying landmarks from observed scenes, tracking navigation progress, and adapting to exceptions with plan adjustment. Furthermore, we show that LLMs is capable of generating high-quality navigational instructions from observations and actions along a path, as well as drawing accurate top-down metric trajectory given the agent's navigation history.

We propose a closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback. In AdaPlanner, the LLM agent adaptively refines its plan from feedback with both in-plan and out-of-plan refinement strategies. To mitigate hallucination, we develop a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a skill discovery mechanism that leverages successful plans as few-shot exemplars, enabling the agent to plan and refine with fewer task demonstrations.

The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from the Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions. Specifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the ""Chain of Thoughts"" mode for effective embodied planning. (ii) We introduce an efficient training approach to EmbodiedGPT for high-quality plan generation, by adapting a 7B large language model (LLM) to the EgoCOT dataset via prefix tuning. (iii) We introduce a paradigm for extracting task-related features from LLM-generated planning queries to form a closed loop between high-level planning and low-level control. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT on embodied tasks, including embodied planning, embodied control, visual captioning, and visual question answering. Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly enhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more effective features. It has achieved a remarkable 1.6 times increase in success rate on the Franka Kitchen benchmark and a 1.3 times increase on the Meta-World benchmark, compared to the BLIP-2 baseline fine-tuned with the Ego4D dataset.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15021v2
Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model,"Shibo Hao, Yi Gu, Haodi Ma, Joshua Jiahua Hong, Zhen Wang, Daisy Zhe Wang, Zhiting Hu",2023-05-24,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities, especially when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, CoT). However, LLMs can still struggle with problems that are easy for humans, such as generating action plans for executing tasks in a given environment, or performing complex math, logical, and commonsense reasoning. The deficiency stems from the key fact that LLMs lack an internal $\textit{world model}$ to predict the world $\textit{state}$ (e.g., environment status, intermediate variable values) and simulate long-term outcomes of actions. This prevents LLMs from performing deliberate planning akin to human brains, which involves exploring alternative reasoning paths, anticipating future states and rewards, and iteratively refining existing reasoning steps. To overcome the limitations, we propose a new LLM reasoning framework, $\underline{R}$easoning vi$\underline{a}$ $\underline{P}$lanning $\textbf{(RAP)}$. RAP repurposes the LLM as both a world model and a reasoning agent, and incorporates a principled planning algorithm (based on Monto Carlo Tree Search) for strategic exploration in the vast reasoning space. During reasoning, the LLM (as agent) incrementally builds a reasoning tree under the guidance of the LLM (as world model) and task-specific rewards, and obtains a high-reward reasoning path efficiently with a proper balance between exploration $\textit{vs.}$ exploitation. We apply RAP to a variety of challenging reasoning problems including plan generation, math reasoning, and logical inference. Empirical results on these tasks demonstrate the superiority of RAP over various strong baselines, including CoT and least-to-most prompting with self-consistency. RAP on LLAMA-33B surpasses CoT on GPT-4 with 33% relative improvement in a plan generation setting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992v2
Leveraging Pre-trained Large Language Models to Construct and Utilize World Models for Model-based Task Planning,"Lin Guan, Karthik Valmeekam, Sarath Sreedharan, Subbarao Kambhampati",2023-05-24,"There is a growing interest in applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to planning problems. However, methods that use LLMs directly as planners are currently impractical due to several factors, including limited correctness of plans, strong reliance on feedback from interactions with simulators or even the actual environment, and the inefficiency in utilizing human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel alternative paradigm that constructs an explicit world (domain) model in planning domain definition language (PDDL) and then uses it to plan with sound domain-independent planners. To address the fact that LLMs may not generate a fully functional PDDL model initially, we employ LLMs as an interface between PDDL and sources of corrective feedback, such as PDDL validators and humans. For users who lack a background in PDDL, we show that LLMs can translate PDDL into natural language and effectively encode corrective feedback back to the underlying domain model. Our framework not only enjoys the correctness guarantee offered by the external planners but also reduces human involvement by allowing users to correct domain models at the beginning, rather than inspecting and correcting (through interactive prompting) every generated plan as in previous work. On two IPC domains and a Household domain that is more complicated than commonly used benchmarks such as ALFWorld, we demonstrate that GPT-4 can be leveraged to produce high-quality PDDL models for over 40 actions, and the corrected PDDL models are then used to successfully solve 48 challenging planning tasks.

To overcome these limitations, we propose CREATOR, a novel framework that enables LLMs to create their own tools using documentation and code realization. CREATOR disentangles abstract tool creation and concrete decision execution, resulting in improved performance. We evaluate CREATOR on MATH and TabMWP benchmarks, respectively consisting of challenging math competition problems and diverse tabular contents. Remarkably, CREATOR outperforms existing chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, and tool-using baselines. Additionally, we introduce the Creation Challenge dataset, featuring 2K diverse questions, to emphasize the necessity and benefits of LLMs' tool creation ability. Further research demonstrates that leveraging LLMs as tool creators facilitates knowledge transfer, and LLMs exhibit varying levels of tool creation abilities, enabling them to adapt to diverse situations. The tool creation ability revolutionizes the LLM's problem-solving paradigm, driving us closer to the next frontier of artificial intelligence.

This paradigm considers language models as agents capable of observing, acting, and receiving feedback iteratively from external entities. Specifically, language models in this context can: (1) interact with humans for better understanding and addressing user needs, personalizing responses, aligning with human values, and improving the overall user experience; (2) interact with knowledge bases for enriching language representations with factual knowledge, enhancing the contextual relevance of responses, and dynamically leveraging external information to generate more accurate and informed responses; (3) interact with models and tools for effectively decomposing and addressing complex tasks, leveraging specialized expertise for specific subtasks, and fostering the simulation of social behaviors; and (4) interact with environments for learning grounded representations of language, and effectively tackling embodied tasks such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making in response to environmental observations.

In this work, we study data-driven offline training for web agents with vision-language foundation models. We propose an instruction-following multimodal agent, WebGUM, that observes both webpage screenshots and HTML pages and outputs web navigation actions, such as click and type. WebGUM is trained by jointly finetuning an instruction-finetuned language model and a vision encoder with temporal and local perception on a large corpus of demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate this recipe improves the agent's ability of grounded multimodal perception, HTML comprehension, and multi-step reasoning, outperforming prior works by a significant margin. On the MiniWoB, we improve over the previous best offline methods by more than 45.8%, even outperforming online-finetuned SoTA, humans, and GPT-4-based agent. On the WebShop benchmark, our 3-billion-parameter model achieves superior performance to the existing SoTA, PaLM-540B. Furthermore, WebGUM exhibits strong positive transfer to the real-world planning tasks on the Mind2Web.

Sensecape: Enabling Multilevel Exploration and Sensemaking with Large Language Models,"Sangho Suh, Bryan Min, Srishti Palani, Haijun Xia",2023-05-19,"People are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) for complex information tasks like academic research or planning a move to another city. However, while they often require working in a nonlinear manner -- e.g., to arrange information spatially to organize and make sense of it, current interfaces for interacting with LLMs are generally linear to support conversational interaction. To address this limitation and explore how we can support LLM-powered exploration and sensemaking, we developed Sensecape, an interactive system designed to support complex information tasks with an LLM by enabling users to (1) manage the complexity of information through multilevel abstraction and (2) seamlessly switch between foraging and sensemaking. Our within-subject user study reveals that Sensecape empowers users to explore more topics and structure their knowledge hierarchically, thanks to the externalization of levels of abstraction.

Instruct2Act: Mapping Multi-modality Instructions to Robotic Actions with Large Language Model,"Siyuan Huang, Zhengkai Jiang, Hao Dong, Yu Qiao, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li",2023-05-18,"Foundation models have made significant strides in various applications, including text-to-image generation, panoptic segmentation, and natural language processing. This paper presents Instruct2Act, a framework that utilizes Large Language Models to map multi-modal instructions to sequential actions for robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, Instruct2Act employs the LLM model to generate Python programs that constitute a comprehensive perception, planning, and action loop for robotic tasks. In the perception section, pre-defined APIs are used to access multiple foundation models where the Segment Anything Model (SAM) accurately locates candidate objects, and CLIP classifies them. In this way, the framework leverages the expertise of foundation models and robotic abilities to convert complex high-level instructions into precise policy codes. Our approach is adjustable and flexible in accommodating various instruction modalities and input types and catering to specific task demands. We validated the practicality and efficiency of our approach by assessing it on robotic tasks in different scenarios within tabletop manipulation domains. Furthermore, our zero-shot method outperformed many state-of-the-art learning-based policies in several tasks.

We measure the relative importance of these two stages by training LIMA, a 65B parameter LLaMa language model fine-tuned with the standard supervised loss on only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses, without any reinforcement learning or human preference modeling. LIMA demonstrates remarkably strong performance, learning to follow specific response formats from only a handful of examples in the training data, including complex queries that range from planning trip itineraries to speculating about alternate history. Moreover, the model tends to generalize well to unseen tasks that did not appear in the training data. In a controlled human study, responses from LIMA are either equivalent or strictly preferred to GPT-4 in 43% of cases; this statistic is as high as 58% when compared to Bard and 65% versus DaVinci003, which was trained with human feedback. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that almost all knowledge in large language models is learned during pretraining, and only limited instruction tuning data is necessary to teach models to produce high quality output.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206v1
Generalized Planning in PDDL Domains with Pretrained Large Language Models,"Tom Silver, Soham Dan, Kavitha Srinivas, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Leslie Pack Kaelbling, Michael Katz",2023-05-18,"Recent work has considered whether large language models (LLMs) can function as planners: given a task, generate a plan. We investigate whether LLMs can serve as generalized planners: given a domain and training tasks, generate a program that efficiently produces plans for other tasks in the domain. In particular, we consider PDDL domains and use GPT-4 to synthesize Python programs. We also consider (1) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) summarization, where the LLM is prompted to summarize the domain and propose a strategy in words before synthesizing the program; and (2) automated debugging, where the program is validated with respect to the training tasks, and in case of errors, the LLM is re-prompted with four types of feedback. We evaluate this approach in seven PDDL domains and compare it to four ablations and four baselines. Overall, we find that GPT-4 is a surprisingly powerful generalized planner. We also conclude that automated debugging is very important, that CoT summarization has non-uniform impact, that GPT-4 is far superior to GPT-3.5, and that just two training tasks are often sufficient for strong generalization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11014v2
Semantically Aligned Task Decomposition in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Wenhao Li, Dan Qiao, Baoxiang Wang, Xiangfeng Wang, Bo Jin, Hongyuan Zha",2023-05-18,"The difficulty of appropriately assigning credit is particularly heightened in cooperative MARL with sparse reward, due to the concurrent time and structural scales involved. Automatic subgoal generation (ASG) has recently emerged as a viable MARL approach inspired by utilizing subgoals in intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning. However, end-to-end learning of complex task planning from sparse rewards without prior knowledge, undoubtedly requires massive training samples. Moreover, the diversity-promoting nature of existing ASG methods can lead to the ""over-representation"" of subgoals, generating numerous spurious subgoals of limited relevance to the actual task reward and thus decreasing the sample efficiency of the algorithm. To address this problem and inspired by the disentangled representation learning, we propose a novel ""disentangled"" decision-making method, Semantically Aligned task decomposition in MARL (SAMA), that prompts pretrained language models with chain-of-thought that can suggest potential goals, provide suitable goal decomposition and subgoal allocation as well as self-reflection-based replanning. Additionally, SAMA incorporates language-grounded RL to train each agent's subgoal-conditioned policy. SAMA demonstrates considerable advantages in sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art ASG methods, as evidenced by its performance on two challenging sparse-reward tasks, Overcooked and MiniRTS.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10865v2
Language Models Meet World Models: Embodied Experiences Enhance Language Models,"Jiannan Xiang, Tianhua Tao, Yi Gu, Tianmin Shu, Zirui Wang, Zichao Yang, Zhiting Hu",2023-05-18,"While large language models (LMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, they often struggle with simple reasoning and planning in physical environments, such as understanding object permanence or planning household activities. The limitation arises from the fact that LMs are trained only on written text and miss essential embodied knowledge and skills. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm of enhancing LMs by finetuning them with world models, to gain diverse embodied knowledge while retaining their general language capabilities. Our approach deploys an embodied agent in a world model, particularly a simulator of the physical world (VirtualHome), and acquires a diverse set of embodied experiences through both goal-oriented planning and random exploration. These experiences are then used to finetune LMs to teach diverse abilities of reasoning and acting in the physical world, e.g., planning and completing goals, object permanence and tracking, etc. Moreover, it is desirable to preserve the generality of LMs during finetuning, which facilitates generalizing the embodied knowledge across tasks rather than being tied to specific simulations. We thus further introduce the classical (EWC) for selective weight updates, combined with low-rank adapters (LoRA) for training efficiency. Extensive experiments show our approach substantially improves base LMs on 18 downstream tasks by 64.28% on average. In particular, the small LMs (1.3B, 6B, and 13B) enhanced by our approach match or even outperform much larger LMs (e.g., ChatGPT).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10626v3
Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models,"Shunyu Yao, Dian Yu, Jeffrey Zhao, Izhak Shafran, Thomas L. Griffiths, Yuan Cao, Karthik Narasimhan",2023-05-17,"Language models are increasingly being deployed for general problem solving across a wide range of tasks, but are still confined to token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference. This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%.

Can Language Models Solve Graph Problems in Natural Language?,"Heng Wang, Shangbin Feng, Tianxing He, Zhaoxuan Tan, Xiaochuang Han, Yulia Tsvetkov",2023-05-17,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for a variety of tasks with implicit graphical structures, such as planning in robotics, multi-hop question answering or knowledge probing, structured commonsense reasoning, and more. While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks with structure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textual descriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces, and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, we propose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark of graph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problems such as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs (GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and find that 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities, 2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on more complex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in the face of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then propose Build-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-based approaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems. Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs on NLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how to solve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with language models remains an open research question.

Sasha: Creative Goal-Oriented Reasoning in Smart Homes with Large Language Models,"Evan King, Haoxiang Yu, Sangsu Lee, Christine Julien",2023-05-16,"Smart home assistants function best when user commands are direct and well-specified (e.g., ""turn on the kitchen light""), or when a hard-coded routine specifies the response. In more natural communication, however, human speech is unconstrained, often describing goals (e.g., ""make it cozy in here"" or ""help me save energy"") rather than indicating specific target devices and actions to take on those devices. Current systems fail to understand these under-specified commands since they cannot reason about devices and settings as they relate to human situations. We introduce large language models (LLMs) to this problem space, exploring their use for controlling devices and creating automation routines in response to under-specified user commands in smart homes. We empirically study the baseline quality and failure modes of LLM-created action plans with a survey of age-diverse users. We find that LLMs can reason creatively to achieve challenging goals, but they experience patterns of failure that diminish their usefulness. We address these gaps with Sasha, a smarter smart home assistant. Sasha responds to loosely-constrained commands like ""make it cozy"" or ""help me sleep better"" by executing plans to achieve user goals, e.g., setting a mood with available devices, or devising automation routines. We implement and evaluate Sasha in a hands-on user study, showing the capabilities and limitations of LLM-driven smart homes when faced with unconstrained user-generated scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09802v3
SatLM: Satisfiability-Aided Language Models Using Declarative Prompting,"Xi Ye, Qiaochu Chen, Isil Dillig, Greg Durrett",2023-05-16,"Prior work has combined chain-of-thought prompting in large language models (LLMs) with programmatic representations to perform effective and transparent reasoning. While such an approach works well for tasks that only require forward reasoning (e.g., straightforward arithmetic), it is less effective for constraint solving problems that require more sophisticated planning and search. In this paper, we propose a new satisfiability-aided language modeling (SatLM) approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use an LLM to generate a declarative task specification rather than an imperative program and leverage an off-the-shelf automated theorem prover to derive the final answer. This approach has two key advantages. The declarative specification is closer to the problem description than the reasoning steps are, so the LLM can parse it out of the description more accurately. Furthermore, by offloading the actual reasoning task to an automated theorem prover, our approach can guarantee the correctness of the answer with respect to the parsed specification and avoid planning errors in the solving process. We evaluate SATLM on 8 different datasets and show that it consistently outperforms program-aided LMs in the imperative paradigm. In particular, SATLM outperforms program-aided LMs by 23% on a challenging subset of the GSM arithmetic reasoning dataset; SATLM also achieves a new SoTA on LSAT and BoardgameQA, surpassing previous models that are trained on the respective training sets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09656v3

In this work, we investigate personalization of household cleanup with robots that can tidy up rooms by picking up objects and putting them away. A key challenge is determining the proper place to put each object, as people's preferences can vary greatly depending on personal taste or cultural background. For instance, one person may prefer storing shirts in the drawer, while another may prefer them on the shelf. We aim to build systems that can learn such preferences from just a handful of examples via prior interactions with a particular person. We show that robots can combine language-based planning and perception with the few-shot summarization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to infer generalized user preferences that are broadly applicable to future interactions.

Artificial Neuropsychology: Are Large Language Models Developing Executive Functions?,Hernan Ceferino Vazquez,2023-05-06,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been rapidly advancing and has demonstrated its ability to perform a wide range of cognitive tasks, including language processing, visual recognition, and decision-making. Part of this progress is due to LLMs (Large Language Models) like those of the GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) family. These models are capable of exhibiting behavior that can be perceived as intelligent. Most authors in Neuropsychology consider intelligent behavior to depend on a number of overarching skills, or Executive Functions (EFs), which rely on the correct functioning of neural networks in the frontal lobes, and have developed a series of tests to evaluate them. In this work, we raise the question of whether LLMs are developing executive functions similar to those of humans as part of their learning, and we evaluate the planning function and working memory of GPT using the popular Towers of Hanoi method. Additionally, we introduce a new variant of the classical method in order to avoid that the solutions are found in the LLM training data (dataleakeage). Preliminary results show that LLMs generates near-optimal solutions in Towers of Hanoi related tasks, adheres to task constraints, and exhibits rapid planning capabilities and efficient working memory usage, indicating a potential development of executive functions. However, these abilities are quite limited and worse than well-trained humans when the tasks are not known and are not part of the training data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04134v2

Recent work has leveraged LLM's ability to generate abstract plans to simplify challenging control tasks, either by action scoring, or action modeling (fine-tuning). However, the transformer architecture inherits several constraints that make it difficult for the LLM to directly serve as the agent: e.g. limited input lengths, fine-tuning inefficiency, bias from pre-training, and incompatibility with non-text environments. To maintain compatibility with a low-level trainable actor, we propose to instead use the knowledge in LLMs to simplify the control problem, rather than solving it. We propose the Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) framework. The Plan module translates a task description into a list of high-level sub-tasks. The Eliminate module masks out irrelevant objects and receptacles from the observation for the current sub-task. Finally, the Track module determines whether the agent has accomplished each sub-task.

In an effort to get the best of both worlds, this paper introduces LLM+P, the first framework that incorporates the strengths of classical planners into LLMs. LLM+P takes in a natural language description of a planning problem, then returns a correct (or optimal) plan for solving that problem in natural language. LLM+P does so by first converting the language description into a file written in the planning domain definition language (PDDL), then leveraging classical planners to quickly find a solution, and then translating the found solution back into natural language. Along with LLM+P, we define a diverse set of different benchmark problems taken from common planning scenarios. Via a comprehensive set of experiments on these benchmark problems, we find that LLM+P is able to provide optimal solutions for most problems, while LLMs fail to provide even feasible plans for most problems.\footnote{The code and results are publicly available at https://github.com/Cranial-XIX/llm-pddl.git.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11477v3
Spatial-Language Attention Policies for Efficient Robot Learning,"Priyam Parashar, Vidhi Jain, Xiaohan Zhang, Jay Vakil, Sam Powers, Yonatan Bisk, Chris Paxton",2023-04-21,"Despite great strides in language-guided manipulation, existing work has been constrained to table-top settings. Table-tops allow for perfect and consistent camera angles, properties are that do not hold in mobile manipulation. Task plans that involve moving around the environment must be robust to egocentric views and changes in the plane and angle of grasp. A further challenge is ensuring this is all true while still being able to learn skills efficiently from limited data. We propose Spatial-Language Attention Policies (SLAP) as a solution. SLAP uses three-dimensional tokens as the input representation to train a single multi-task, language-conditioned action prediction policy. Our method shows an 80% success rate in the real world across eight tasks with a single model, and a 47.5% success rate when unseen clutter and unseen object configurations are introduced, even with only a handful of examples per task. This represents an improvement of 30% over prior work (20% given unseen distractors and configurations). We see a 4x improvement over baseline in mobile manipulation setting. In addition, we show how SLAPs robustness allows us to execute Task Plans from open-vocabulary instructions using a large language model for multi-step mobile manipulation.

Robot-Enabled Construction Assembly with Automated Sequence Planning based on ChatGPT: RoboGPT,"Hengxu You, Yang Ye, Tianyu Zhou, Qi Zhu, Jing Du",2023-04-21,"Robot-based assembly in construction has emerged as a promising solution to address numerous challenges such as increasing costs, labor shortages, and the demand for safe and efficient construction processes. One of the main obstacles in realizing the full potential of these robotic systems is the need for effective and efficient sequence planning for construction tasks. Current approaches, including mathematical and heuristic techniques or machine learning methods, face limitations in their adaptability and scalability to dynamic construction environments. To expand the ability of the current robot system in sequential understanding, this paper introduces RoboGPT, a novel system that leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of ChatGPT, a large language model, for automated sequence planning in robot-based assembly applied to construction tasks. The proposed system adapts ChatGPT for construction sequence planning and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness through experimental evaluation including Two case studies and 80 trials about real construction tasks. The results show that RoboGPT-driven robots can handle complex construction operations and adapt to changes on the fly. This paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance the capabilities and performance of robot-based assembly systems in the construction industry, and it paves the way for further integration of large language model technologies in the field of construction robotics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11018v1
LLM as A Robotic Brain: Unifying Egocentric Memory and Control,"Jinjie Mai, Jun Chen, Bing Li, Guocheng Qian, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Bernard Ghanem",2023-04-19,"Embodied AI focuses on the study and development of intelligent systems that possess a physical or virtual embodiment (i.e. robots) and are able to dynamically interact with their environment. Memory and control are the two essential parts of an embodied system and usually require separate frameworks to model each of them. In this paper, we propose a novel and generalizable framework called LLM-Brain: using Large-scale Language Model as a robotic brain to unify egocentric memory and control. The LLM-Brain framework integrates multiple multimodal language models for robotic tasks, utilizing a zero-shot learning approach. All components within LLM-Brain communicate using natural language in closed-loop multi-round dialogues that encompass perception, planning, control, and memory. The core of the system is an embodied LLM to maintain egocentric memory and control the robot. We demonstrate LLM-Brain by examining two downstream tasks: active exploration and embodied question answering. The active exploration tasks require the robot to extensively explore an unknown environment within a limited number of actions. Meanwhile, the embodied question answering tasks necessitate that the robot answers questions based on observations acquired during prior explorations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09349v4
Pretrained Language Models as Visual Planners for Human Assistance,"Dhruvesh Patel, Hamid Eghbalzadeh, Nitin Kamra, Michael Louis Iuzzolino, Unnat Jain, Ruta Desai",2023-04-17,"In our pursuit of advancing multi-modal AI assistants capable of guiding users to achieve complex multi-step goals, we propose the task of ""Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA)"". Given a succinct natural language goal, e.g., ""make a shelf"", and a video of the user's progress so far, the aim of VPA is to devise a plan, i.e., a sequence of actions such as ""sand shelf"", ""paint shelf"", etc. to realize the specified goal. This requires assessing the user's progress from the (untrimmed) video, and relating it to the requirements of natural language goal, i.e., which actions to select and in what order? Consequently, this requires handling long video history and arbitrarily complex action dependencies. To address these challenges, we decompose VPA into video action segmentation and forecasting. Importantly, we experiment by formulating the forecasting step as a multi-modal sequence modeling problem, allowing us to leverage the strength of pre-trained LMs (as the sequence model). This novel approach, which we call Visual Language Model based Planner (VLaMP), outperforms baselines across a suite of metrics that gauge the quality of the generated plans. Furthermore, through comprehensive ablations, we also isolate the value of each component--language pre-training, visual observations, and goal information. We have open-sourced all the data, model checkpoints, and training code.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09179v3
VISAR: A Human-AI Argumentative Writing Assistant with Visual Programming and Rapid Draft Prototyping,"Zheng Zhang, Jie Gao, Ranjodh Singh Dhaliwal, Toby Jia-Jun Li",2023-04-16,"In argumentative writing, writers must brainstorm hierarchical writing goals, ensure the persuasiveness of their arguments, and revise and organize their plans through drafting. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made interactive text generation through a chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT) possible. However, this approach often neglects implicit writing context and user intent, lacks support for user control and autonomy, and provides limited assistance for sensemaking and revising writing plans. To address these challenges, we introduce VISAR, an AI-enabled writing assistant system designed to help writers brainstorm and revise hierarchical goals within their writing context, organize argument structures through synchronized text editing and visual programming, and enhance persuasiveness with argumentation spark recommendations. VISAR allows users to explore, experiment with, and validate their writing plans using automatic draft prototyping.

API-Bank: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Tool-Augmented LLMs,"Minghao Li, Yingxiu Zhao, Bowen Yu, Feifan Song, Hangyu Li, Haiyang Yu, Zhoujun Li, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li",2023-04-14,"Recent research has demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance their capabilities by utilizing external tools. However, three pivotal questions remain unanswered: (1) How effective are current LLMs in utilizing tools? (2) How can we enhance LLMs' ability to utilize tools? (3) What obstacles need to be overcome to leverage tools? To address these questions, we introduce API-Bank, a groundbreaking benchmark, specifically designed for tool-augmented LLMs. For the first question, we develop a runnable evaluation system consisting of 73 API tools. We annotate 314 tool-use dialogues with 753 API calls to assess the existing LLMs' capabilities in planning, retrieving, and calling APIs. For the second question, we construct a comprehensive training set containing 1,888 tool-use dialogues from 2,138 APIs spanning 1,000 distinct domains. Using this dataset, we train Lynx, a tool-augmented LLM initialized from Alpaca. Experimental results demonstrate that GPT-3.5 exhibits improved tool utilization compared to GPT-3, while GPT-4 excels in planning. However, there is still significant potential for further improvement. Moreover, Lynx surpasses Alpaca's tool utilization performance by more than 26 pts and approaches the effectiveness of GPT-3.5.

Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,"Joon Sung Park, Joseph C. O'Brien, Carrie J. Cai, Meredith Ringel Morris, Percy Liang, Michael S. Bernstein",2023-04-07,"Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442v2
Querying Large Language Models with SQL,"Mohammed Saeed, Nicola De Cao, Paolo Papotti",2023-04-02,"In many use-cases, information is stored in text but not available in structured data. However, extracting data from natural language text to precisely fit a schema, and thus enable querying, is a challenging task. With the rise of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), there is now an effective solution to store and use information extracted from massive corpora of text documents. Thus, we envision the use of SQL queries to cover a broad range of data that is not captured by traditional databases by tapping the information in LLMs. To ground this vision, we present Galois, a prototype based on a traditional database architecture, but with new physical operators for querying the underlying LLM. The main idea is to execute some operators of the the query plan with prompts that retrieve data from the LLM. For a large class of SQL queries, querying LLMs returns well structured relations, with encouraging qualitative results. Preliminary experimental results make pre-trained LLMs a promising addition to the field of database systems, introducing a new direction for hybrid query processing. However, we pinpoint several research challenges that must be addressed to build a DBMS that exploits LLMs. While some of these challenges necessitate integrating concepts from the NLP literature, others offer novel research avenues for the DB community.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00472v3

While there are numerous AI models available for various domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks autonomously. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional abilities in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks, with language serving as a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, an LLM-powered agent that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in Hugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face, HuggingGPT can tackle a wide range of sophisticated AI tasks spanning different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards the realization of artificial general intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580v4
DERA: Enhancing Large Language Model Completions with Dialog-Enabled Resolving Agents,"Varun Nair, Elliot Schumacher, Geoffrey Tso, Anitha Kannan",2023-03-30,"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as valuable tools for many natural language understanding tasks. In safety-critical applications such as healthcare, the utility of these models is governed by their ability to generate outputs that are factually accurate and complete. In this work, we present dialog-enabled resolving agents (DERA). DERA is a paradigm made possible by the increased conversational abilities of LLMs, namely GPT-4. It provides a simple, interpretable forum for models to communicate feedback and iteratively improve output. We frame our dialog as a discussion between two agent types - a Researcher, who processes information and identifies crucial problem components, and a Decider, who has the autonomy to integrate the Researcher's information and makes judgments on the final output.   We test DERA against three clinically-focused tasks. For medical conversation summarization and care plan generation, DERA shows significant improvement over the base GPT-4 performance in both human expert preference evaluations and quantitative metrics. In a new finding, we also show that GPT-4's performance (70%) on an open-ended version of the MedQA question-answering (QA) dataset (Jin et al. 2021, USMLE) is well above the passing level (60%), with DERA showing similar performance.

Skill Reinforcement Learning and Planning for Open-World Long-Horizon Tasks,"Haoqi Yuan, Chi Zhang, Hongcheng Wang, Feiyang Xie, Penglin Cai, Hao Dong, Zongqing Lu",2023-03-29,"We study building multi-task agents in open-world environments. Without human demonstrations, learning to accomplish long-horizon tasks in a large open-world environment with reinforcement learning (RL) is extremely inefficient. To tackle this challenge, we convert the multi-task learning problem into learning basic skills and planning over the skills. Using the popular open-world game Minecraft as the testbed, we propose three types of fine-grained basic skills, and use RL with intrinsic rewards to acquire skills. A novel Finding-skill that performs exploration to find diverse items provides better initialization for other skills, improving the sample efficiency for skill learning. In skill planning, we leverage the prior knowledge in Large Language Models to find the relationships between skills and build a skill graph. When the agent is solving a task, our skill search algorithm walks on the skill graph and generates the proper skill plans for the agent. In experiments, our method accomplishes 40 diverse Minecraft tasks, where many tasks require sequentially executing for more than 10 skills. Our method outperforms baselines by a large margin and is the most sample-efficient demonstration-free RL method to solve Minecraft Tech Tree tasks.

Planning with Sequence Models through Iterative Energy Minimization,"Hongyi Chen, Yilun Du, Yiye Chen, Joshua Tenenbaum, Patricio A. Vela",2023-03-28,"Recent works have shown that sequence modeling can be effectively used to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, the success of applying existing sequence models to planning, in which we wish to obtain a trajectory of actions to reach some goal, is less straightforward. The typical autoregressive generation procedures of sequence models preclude sequential refinement of earlier steps, which limits the effectiveness of a predicted plan. In this paper, we suggest an approach towards integrating planning with sequence models based on the idea of iterative energy minimization, and illustrate how such a procedure leads to improved RL performance across different tasks. We train a masked language model to capture an implicit energy function over trajectories of actions, and formulate planning as finding a trajectory of actions with minimum energy. We illustrate how this procedure enables improved performance over recent approaches across BabyAI and Atari environments. We further demonstrate unique benefits of our iterative optimization procedure, involving new task generalization, test-time constraints adaptation, and the ability to compose plans together.

Explicit Planning Helps Language Models in Logical Reasoning,"Hongyu Zhao, Kangrui Wang, Mo Yu, Hongyuan Mei",2023-03-28,"Language models have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

Explicit planning enables the system to make more informed reasoning decisions at each step by looking ahead into their future effects. Moreover, we propose a training strategy that safeguards the planning process from being led astray by spurious features. Our full system significantly outperforms other competing methods on multiple standard datasets. When using small T5 models as its core selection and deduction components, our system performs competitively compared to GPT-3 despite having only about 1B parameters (i.e., 175 times smaller than GPT-3). When using GPT-3.5, it significantly outperforms chain-of-thought prompting on the challenging PrOntoQA dataset.

"""Get ready for a party"": Exploring smarter smart spaces with help from large language models","Evan King, Haoxiang Yu, Sangsu Lee, Christine Julien",2023-03-24,"The right response to someone who says ""get ready for a party"" is deeply influenced by meaning and context. For a smart home assistant (e.g., Google Home), the ideal response might be to survey the available devices in the home and change their state to create a festive atmosphere. Current practical systems cannot service such requests since they require the ability to (1) infer meaning behind an abstract statement and (2) map that inference to a concrete course of action appropriate for the context (e.g., changing the settings of specific devices). In this paper, we leverage the observation that recent task-agnostic large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 embody a vast amount of cross-domain, sometimes unpredictable contextual knowledge that existing rule-based home assistant systems lack, which can make them powerful tools for inferring user intent and generating appropriate context-dependent responses during smart home interactions. We first explore the feasibility of a system that places an LLM at the center of command inference and action planning, showing that LLMs have the capacity to infer intent behind vague, context-dependent commands like ""get ready for a party"" and respond with concrete, machine-parseable instructions that can be used to control smart devices. We furthermore demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation that puts an LLM in control of real devices, showing its ability to infer intent and change device state appropriately with no fine-tuning or task-specific training. Our work hints at the promise of LLM-driven systems for context-awareness in smart environments, motivating future research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14143v1

Objective: This study aims to develop and evaluate a variety of NLP algorithms to extract and categorize physical rehabilitation exercise information from the clinical notes of post-stroke patients treated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A cohort of 13,605 patients diagnosed with stroke was identified, and their clinical notes containing rehabilitation therapy notes were retrieved. A comprehensive clinical ontology was created to represent various aspects of physical rehabilitation exercises.

The rule-based NLP algorithm demonstrated superior performance in most areas, particularly in detecting the 'Right Side' location with an F1 score of 0.975, outperforming Gradient Boosting by 0.063. Gradient Boosting excelled in 'Lower Extremity' location detection (F1 score: 0.978), surpassing rule-based NLP by 0.023.

Maximizing Penetration Testing Success with Effective Reconnaissance Techniques using ChatGPT,Sheetal Temara,2023-03-20,"ChatGPT is a generative pretrained transformer language model created using artificial intelligence implemented as chatbot which can provide very detailed responses to a wide variety of questions.

Chat with the Environment: Interactive Multimodal Perception Using Large Language Models,"Xufeng Zhao, Mengdi Li, Cornelius Weber, Muhammad Burhan Hafez, Stefan Wermter",2023-03-14,"Programming robot behavior in a complex world faces challenges on multiple levels, from dextrous low-level skills to high-level planning and reasoning. Recent pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability in few-shot robotic planning. However, it remains challenging to ground LLMs in multimodal sensory input and continuous action output, while enabling a robot to interact with its environment and acquire novel information as its policies unfold. We develop a robot interaction scenario with a partially observable state, which necessitates a robot to decide on a range of epistemic actions in order to sample sensory information among multiple modalities, before being able to execute the task correctly. Matcha (Multimodal environment chatting) agent, an interactive perception framework, is therefore proposed with an LLM as its backbone, whose ability is exploited to instruct epistemic actions and to reason over the resulting multimodal sensations (vision, sound, haptics, proprioception), as well as to plan an entire task execution based on the interactively acquired information. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can provide high-level planning and reasoning skills and control interactive robot behavior in a multimodal environment, while multimodal modules with the context of the environmental state help ground the LLMs and extend their processing ability.

Planning with Large Language Models for Code Generation,"Shun Zhang, Zhenfang Chen, Yikang Shen, Mingyu Ding, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Chuang Gan",2023-03-09,"Existing large language model-based code generation pipelines typically use beam search or sampling algorithms during the decoding process. Although the programs they generate achieve high token-matching-based scores, they often fail to compile or generate incorrect outputs. The main reason is that conventional Transformer decoding algorithms may not be the best choice for code generation. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer decoding algorithm, Planning-Guided Transformer Decoding (PG-TD), that uses a planning algorithm to do lookahead search and guide the Transformer to generate better programs. Specifically, instead of simply optimizing the likelihood of the generated sequences, the Transformer makes use of a planner to generate candidate programs and test them on public test cases. The Transformer can therefore make more informed decisions and generate tokens that will eventually lead to higher-quality programs. We also design a mechanism that shares information between the Transformer and the planner to make our algorithm computationally efficient. We empirically evaluate our framework with several large language models as backbones on public coding challenge benchmarks, showing that 1) it can generate programs that consistently achieve higher performance compared with competing baseline methods; 2) it enables controllable code generation, such as concise codes and highly-commented codes by optimizing modified objective.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05510v1

A Framework for Neurosymbolic Robot Action Planning using Large Language Models,"Alessio Capitanelli, Fulvio Mastrogiovanni",2023-03-01,"Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy due to its ease of understanding and deployment in robot architectures. However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in real-world, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance in complex planning domains or when frequent re-planning is needed. We present a framework, Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs' response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the output, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of end-to-end, making each action available for execution as soon as it is generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn enables concurrent planning and execution. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted by the research community to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to provide an overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities to build a look-ahead predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000 samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by up to 61.4%",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00438v3
Offline Reinforcement Learning for Mixture-of-Expert Dialogue Management,"Dhawal Gupta, Yinlam Chow, Aza Tulepbergenov, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Craig Boutilier",2023-02-21,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise for developing dialogue management (DM) agents that are non-myopic, conduct rich conversations, and maximize overall user satisfaction. Despite recent developments in RL and language models (LMs), using RL to power conversational chatbots remains challenging, in part because RL requires online exploration to learn effectively, whereas collecting novel human-bot interactions can be expensive and unsafe. This issue is exacerbated by the combinatorial action spaces facing these algorithms, as most LM agents generate responses at the word level. We develop a variety of RL algorithms, specialized to dialogue planning, that leverage recent Mixture-of-Expert Language Models (MoE-LMs) -- models that capture diverse semantics, generate utterances reflecting different intents, and are amenable for multi-turn DM. By exploiting MoE-LM structure, our methods significantly reduce the size of the action space and improve the efficacy of RL-based DM. We evaluate our methods in open-domain dialogue to demonstrate their effectiveness w.r.t.\ the diversity of intent in generated utterances and overall DM performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10850v2
Exploring the Limits of ChatGPT for Query or Aspect-based Text Summarization,"Xianjun Yang, Yan Li, Xinlu Zhang, Haifeng Chen, Wei Cheng",2023-02-16,"Text summarization has been a crucial problem in natural language processing (NLP) for several decades. It aims to condense lengthy documents into shorter versions while retaining the most critical information. Various methods have been proposed for text summarization, including extractive and abstractive summarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 and ChatGPT has recently created significant interest in using these models for text summarization tasks. Recent studies \cite{goyal2022news, zhang2023benchmarking} have shown that LLMs-generated news summaries are already on par with humans. However, the performance of LLMs for more practical applications like aspect or query-based summaries is underexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted an evaluation of ChatGPT's performance on four widely used benchmark datasets, encompassing diverse summaries from Reddit posts, news articles, dialogue meetings, and stories. Our experiments reveal that ChatGPT's performance is comparable to traditional fine-tuning methods in terms of Rouge scores. Moreover, we highlight some unique differences between ChatGPT-generated summaries and human references, providing valuable insights into the superpower of ChatGPT for diverse text summarization tasks. Our findings call for new directions in this area, and we plan to conduct further research to systematically examine the characteristics of ChatGPT-generated summaries through extensive human evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08081v1
On the Planning Abilities of Large Language Models (A Critical Investigation with a Proposed Benchmark),"Karthik Valmeekam, Sarath Sreedharan, Matthew Marquez, Alberto Olmo, Subbarao Kambhampati",2023-02-13,"Intrigued by the claims of emergent reasoning capabilities in LLMs trained on general web corpora, in this paper, we set out to investigate their planning capabilities. We aim to evaluate (1) how good LLMs are by themselves in generating and validating simple plans in commonsense planning tasks (of the type that humans are generally quite good at) and (2) how good LLMs are in being a source of heuristic guidance for other agents--either AI planners or human planners--in their planning tasks. To investigate these questions in a systematic rather than anecdotal manner, we start by developing a benchmark suite based on the kinds of domains employed in the International Planning Competition. On this benchmark, we evaluate LLMs in three modes: autonomous, heuristic and human-in-the-loop. Our results show that LLM's ability to autonomously generate executable plans is quite meager, averaging only about 3% success rate. The heuristic and human-in-the-loop modes show slightly more promise. In addition to these results, we also make our benchmark and evaluation tools available to support investigations by research community.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06706v1
Translating Natural Language to Planning Goals with Large-Language Models,"Yaqi Xie, Chen Yu, Tongyao Zhu, Jinbin Bai, Ze Gong, Harold Soh",2023-02-10,"Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, leading to intense excitement about their applicability across various domains. Unfortunately, recent work has also shown that LLMs are unable to perform accurate reasoning nor solve planning problems, which may limit their usefulness for robotics-related tasks. In this work, our central question is whether LLMs are able to translate goals specified in natural language to a structured planning language. If so, LLM can act as a natural interface between the planner and human users; the translated goal can be handed to domain-independent AI planners that are very effective at planning. Our empirical results on GPT 3.5 variants show that LLMs are much better suited towards translation rather than planning. We find that LLMs are able to leverage commonsense knowledge and reasoning to furnish missing details from under-specified goals (as is often the case in natural language). However, our experiments also reveal that LLMs can fail to generate goals in tasks that involve numerical or physical (e.g., spatial) reasoning, and that LLMs are sensitive to the prompts used. As such, these models are promising for translation to structured planning languages, but care should be taken in their use.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05128v1
Few-Shot Table-to-Text Generation with Prompt Planning and Knowledge Memorization,"Zhixin Guo, Minyxuan Yan, Jiexing Qi, Jianping Zhou, Ziwei He, Zhouhan Lin, Guanjie Zheng, Xinbing Wang",2023-02-09,"Pre-trained language models (PLM) have achieved remarkable advancement in table-to-text generation tasks. However, the lack of labeled domain-specific knowledge and the topology gap between tabular data and text make it difficult for PLMs to yield faithful text. Low-resource generation likewise faces unique challenges in this domain. Inspired by how humans descript tabular data with prior knowledge, we suggest a new framework: PromptMize, which targets table-to-text generation under few-shot settings. The design of our framework consists of two aspects: a prompt planner and a knowledge adapter. The prompt planner aims to generate a prompt signal that provides instance guidance for PLMs to bridge the topology gap between tabular data and text. Moreover, the knowledge adapter memorizes domain-specific knowledge from the unlabelled corpus to supply essential information during generation. Extensive experiments and analyses are investigated on three open domain few-shot NLG datasets: human, song, and book. Compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches, our model achieves remarkable performance in generating quality as judged by human and automatic evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04415v3
PubGraph: A Large-Scale Scientific Knowledge Graph,"Kian Ahrabian, Xinwei Du, Richard Delwin Myloth, Arun Baalaaji Sankar Ananthan, Jay Pujara",2023-02-04,"Research publications are the primary vehicle for sharing scientific progress in the form of new discoveries, methods, techniques, and insights. Unfortunately, the lack of a large-scale, comprehensive, and easy-to-use resource capturing the myriad relationships between publications, their authors, and venues presents a barrier to applications for gaining a deeper understanding of science. In this paper, we present PubGraph, a new resource for studying scientific progress that takes the form of a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) with more than 385M entities, 13B main edges, and 1.5B qualifier edges. PubGraph is comprehensive and unifies data from various sources, including Wikidata, OpenAlex, and Semantic Scholar, using the Wikidata ontology. Beyond the metadata available from these sources, PubGraph includes outputs from auxiliary community detection algorithms and large language models. To further support studies on reasoning over scientific networks, we create several large-scale benchmarks extracted from PubGraph for the core task of knowledge graph completion (KGC). These benchmarks present many challenges for knowledge graph embedding models, including an adversarial community-based KGC evaluation setting, zero-shot inductive learning, and large-scale learning. All of the aforementioned resources are accessible at https://pubgraph.isi.edu/ and released under the CC-BY-SA license.

"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select: Interactive Planning with Large Language Models Enables Open-World Multi-Task Agents","Zihao Wang, Shaofei Cai, Guanzhou Chen, Anji Liu, Xiaojian Ma, Yitao Liang",2023-02-03,"We investigate the challenge of task planning for multi-task embodied agents in open-world environments. Two main difficulties are identified: 1) executing plans in an open-world environment (e.g., Minecraft) necessitates accurate and multi-step reasoning due to the long-term nature of tasks, and 2) as vanilla planners do not consider how easy the current agent can achieve a given sub-task when ordering parallel sub-goals within a complicated plan, the resulting plan could be inefficient or even infeasible. To this end, we propose ""$\underline{D}$escribe, $\underline{E}$xplain, $\underline{P}$lan and $\underline{S}$elect"" ($\textbf{DEPS}$), an interactive planning approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs). DEPS facilitates better error correction on initial LLM-generated $\textit{plan}$ by integrating $\textit{description}$ of the plan execution process and providing self-$\textit{explanation}$ of feedback when encountering failures during the extended planning phases. Furthermore, it includes a goal $\textit{selector}$, which is a trainable module that ranks parallel candidate sub-goals based on the estimated steps of completion, consequently refining the initial plan. Our experiments mark the milestone of the first zero-shot multi-task agent that can robustly accomplish 70+ Minecraft tasks and nearly double the overall performances. Further testing reveals our method's general effectiveness in popularly adopted non-open-ended domains as well (i.e., ALFWorld and tabletop manipulation). The ablation and exploratory studies detail how our design beats the counterparts and provide a promising update on the $\texttt{ObtainDiamond}$ grand challenge with our approach.

Context Matters: A Strategy to Pre-train Language Model for Science Education,"Zhengliang Liu, Xinyu He, Lei Liu, Tianming Liu, Xiaoming Zhai",2023-01-27,"This study aims at improving the performance of scoring student responses in science education automatically. BERT-based language models have shown significant superiority over traditional NLP models in various language-related tasks. However, science writing of students, including argumentation and explanation, is domain-specific. In addition, the language used by students is different from the language in journals and Wikipedia, which are training sources of BERT and its existing variants. All these suggest that a domain-specific model pre-trained using science education data may improve model performance. However, the ideal type of data to contextualize pre-trained language model and improve the performance in automatically scoring student written responses remains unclear. Therefore, we employ different data in this study to contextualize both BERT and SciBERT models and compare their performance on automatic scoring of assessment tasks for scientific argumentation. We use three datasets to pre-train the model: 1) journal articles in science education, 2) a large dataset of students' written responses (sample size over 50,000), and 3) a small dataset of students' written responses of scientific argumentation tasks. Our experimental results show that in-domain training corpora constructed from science questions and responses improve language model performance on a wide variety of downstream tasks. Our study confirms the effectiveness of continual pre-training on domain-specific data in the education domain and demonstrates a generalizable strategy for automating science education tasks with high accuracy. We plan to release our data and SciEdBERT models for public use and community engagement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12031v1
A Multi-View Joint Learning Framework for Embedding Clinical Codes and Text Using Graph Neural Networks,"Lecheng Kong, Christopher King, Bradley Fritz, Yixin Chen",2023-01-27,"Learning to represent free text is a core task in many clinical machine learning (ML) applications, as clinical text contains observations and plans not otherwise available for inference. State-of-the-art methods use large language models developed with immense computational resources and training data; however, applying these models is challenging because of the highly varying syntax and vocabulary in clinical free text. Structured information such as International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes often succinctly abstracts the most important facts of a clinical encounter and yields good performance, but is often not as available as clinical text in real-world scenarios. We propose a \textbf{multi-view learning framework} that jointly learns from codes and text to combine the availability and forward-looking nature of text and better performance of ICD codes. The learned text embeddings can be used as inputs to predictive algorithms independent of the ICD codes during inference. Our approach uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to process ICD codes, and Bi-LSTM to process text. We apply Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) to enforce the two views to learn a similar representation of each patient. In experiments using planned surgical procedure text, our model outperforms BERT models fine-tuned to clinical data, and in experiments using diverse text in MIMIC-III, our model is competitive to a fine-tuned BERT at a tiny fraction of its computational effort.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11608v1

We build a large set of tasks by combining crowdsourced and simulated gameplays with a novel dataset of complex actions in order to to construct such models.

Goodman, Nick Haber",2022-12-20,"Despite recent success in large language model (LLM) reasoning, LLMs struggle with hierarchical multi-step reasoning tasks like generating complex programs. For these tasks, humans often start with a high-level algorithmic design and implement each part gradually. We introduce Parsel, a framework enabling automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms with code LLMs. With Parsel, we automatically decompose algorithmic tasks into hierarchical natural language function descriptions and then search over combinations of possible function implementations using tests. We show that Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis and robotic planning. We find that, using Parsel, LLMs solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in pass rates over 75\% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex, while often using a smaller sample budget. Moreover, with automatically generated tests, we find that Parsel can improve the state-of-the-art pass@1 performance on HumanEval from 67\% to 85\%. We also find that LLM-generated robotic plans using Parsel are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans. Lastly, we explore how Parsel addresses LLM limitations and discuss how Parsel may be useful for human programmers.

"Don't Generate, Discriminate: A Proposal for Grounding Language Models to Real-World Environments","Yu Gu, Xiang Deng, Yu Su",2022-12-19,"A key missing capacity of current language models (LMs) is grounding to real-world environments. Most existing work for grounded language understanding uses LMs to directly generate plans that can be executed in the environment to achieve the desired effects. It thereby casts the burden of ensuring grammaticality, faithfulness, and controllability all on the LMs. We propose Pangu, a generic framework for grounded language understanding that capitalizes on the discriminative ability of LMs instead of their generative ability. Pangu consists of a symbolic agent and a neural LM working in a concerted fashion: The agent explores the environment to incrementally construct valid plans, and the LM evaluates the plausibility of the candidate plans to guide the search process. A case study on the challenging problem of knowledge base question answering (KBQA), which features a massive environment, demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness and flexibility of Pangu: A BERT-base LM is sufficient for setting a new record on standard KBQA datasets, and larger LMs further bring substantial gains. Pangu also enables, for the first time, effective few-shot in-context learning for KBQA with large LMs such as Codex.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09736v2
Neural Story Planning,"Anbang Ye, Christopher Cui, Taiwei Shi, Mark O. Riedl",2022-12-16,"Automated plot generation is the challenge of generating a sequence of events that will be perceived by readers as the plot of a coherent story. Traditional symbolic planners plan a story from a goal state and guarantee logical causal plot coherence but rely on a library of hand-crafted actions with their preconditions and effects. This closed world setting limits the length and diversity of what symbolic planners can generate. On the other hand, pre-trained neural language models can generate stories with great diversity, while being generally incapable of ending a story in a specified manner and can have trouble maintaining coherence. In this paper, we present an approach to story plot generation that unifies causal planning with neural language models. We propose to use commonsense knowledge extracted from large language models to recursively expand a story plot in a backward chaining fashion. Specifically, our system infers the preconditions for events in the story and then events that will cause those conditions to become true. We performed automatic evaluation to measure narrative coherence as indicated by the ability to answer questions about whether different events in the story are causally related to other events. Results indicate that our proposed method produces more coherent plotlines than several strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08718v1

From BERT to BLOOM, LLMs have surpassed state-of-the-art results in various natural language tasks such as question answering, summarization, and text generation. Many ongoing efforts focus on understanding LLMs' capabilities, including their knowledge of the world, syntax, and semantics. However, extending the textual prowess of LLMs to symbolic reasoning has been slow and predominantly focused on tackling problems related to the mathematical field. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automated planning - a branch of AI concerned with the realization of action sequences (plans) to achieve a goal, typically executed by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, and unmanned vehicles. We introduce Plansformer; an LLM fine-tuned on planning problems and capable of generating plans with favorable behavior in terms of correctness and length with reduced knowledge-engineering efforts. We also demonstrate the adaptability of Plansformer in solving different planning domains with varying complexities, owing to the transfer learning abilities of LLMs. For one configuration of Plansformer, we achieve ~97% valid plans, out of which ~95% are optimal for Towers of Hanoi - a puzzle-solving domain.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08681v1
POIBERT: A Transformer-based Model for the Tour Recommendation Problem,"Ngai Lam Ho, Kwan Hui Lim",2022-12-16,"Tour itinerary planning and recommendation are challenging problems for tourists visiting unfamiliar cities. Many tour recommendation algorithms only consider factors such as the location and popularity of Points of Interest (POIs) but their solutions may not align well with the user's own preferences and other location constraints. Additionally, these solutions do not take into consideration of the users' preference based on their past POIs selection. In this paper, we propose POIBERT, an algorithm for recommending personalized itineraries using the BERT language model on POIs. POIBERT builds upon the highly successful BERT language model with the novel adaptation of a language model to our itinerary recommendation task, alongside an iterative approach to generate consecutive POIs.   Our recommendation algorithm is able to generate a sequence of POIs that optimizes time and users' preference in POI categories based on past trajectories from similar tourists. Our tour recommendation algorithm is modeled by adapting the itinerary recommendation problem to the sentence completion problem in natural language processing (NLP). We also innovate an iterative algorithm to generate travel itineraries that satisfies the time constraints which is most likely from past trajectories. Using a Flickr dataset of seven cities, experimental results show that our algorithm out-performs many sequence prediction algorithms based on measures in recall, precision and F1-scores.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13900v1

We further propose a simple but effective way to enhance LLMs with physical grounding to generate and update plans that are grounded in the current environment. Experiments on the ALFRED dataset show that our method can achieve very competitive few-shot performance: Despite using less than 0.5% of paired training data, LLM-Planner achieves competitive performance with recent baselines that are trained using the full training data.

We design few-shot and conventional experiment settings along with a carefully designed matching algorithm to evaluate extraction results. We report the performance of strong baselines and offer three observations: (1) generalizing to new document templates is still very challenging, (2) few-shot performance has a lot of headroom, and (3) models struggle with hierarchical fields such as line-items in an invoice.

We then revise by (c) reranking different continuations for plot coherence and premise relevance, and finally (d) editing the best continuation for factual consistency.

Generating Executable Action Plans with Environmentally-Aware Language Models,"Maitrey Gramopadhye, Daniel Szafir",2022-10-10,"Large Language Models (LLMs) trained using massive text datasets have recently shown promise in generating action plans for robotic agents from high level text queries. However, these models typically do not consider the robot's environment, resulting in generated plans that may not actually be executable, due to ambiguities in the planned actions or environmental constraints. In this paper, we propose an approach to generate environmentally-aware action plans that agents are better able to execute. Our approach involves integrating environmental objects and object relations as additional inputs into LLM action plan generation to provide the system with an awareness of its surroundings, resulting in plans where each generated action is mapped to objects present in the scene. We also design a novel scoring function that, along with generating the action steps and associating them with objects, helps the system disambiguate among object instances and take into account their states. We evaluated our approach using the VirtualHome simulator and the ActivityPrograms knowledge base and found that action plans generated from our system had a 310% improvement in executability and a 147% improvement in correctness over prior work.

ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models,"Shunyu Yao, Jeffrey Zhao, Dian Yu, Nan Du, Izhak Shafran, Karthik Narasimhan, Yuan Cao",2022-10-06,"While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

Robot Task Planning and Situation Handling in Open Worlds,"Yan Ding, Xiaohan Zhang, Saeid Amiri, Nieqing Cao, Hao Yang, Chad Esselink, Shiqi Zhang",2022-10-04,"Automated task planning algorithms have been developed to help robots complete complex tasks that require multiple actions. Most of those algorithms have been developed for ""closed worlds"" assuming complete world knowledge is provided. However, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break the planner's completeness. This paper introduces a novel algorithm (COWP) for open-world task planning and situation handling that dynamically augments the robot's action knowledge with task-oriented common sense. In particular, common sense is extracted from Large Language Models based on the current task at hand and robot skills. For systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 561 execution-time situations in a dining domain, where each situation corresponds to a state instance of a robot being potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks. Additionally, we have demonstrated COWP using a mobile manipulator. Supplementary materials are available at: https://cowplanning.github.io/",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01287v1
ProgPrompt: Generating Situated Robot Task Plans using Large Language Models,"Ishika Singh, Valts Blukis, Arsalan Mousavian, Ankit Goyal, Danfei Xu, Jonathan Tremblay, Dieter Fox, Jesse Thomason, Animesh Garg",2022-09-22,"Task planning can require defining myriad domain knowledge about the world in which a robot needs to act. To ameliorate that effort, large language models (LLMs) can be used to score potential next actions during task planning, and even generate action sequences directly, given an instruction in natural language with no additional domain information. However, such methods either require enumerating all possible next steps for scoring, or generate free-form text that may contain actions not possible on a given robot in its current context. We present a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation functional across situated environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. Our key insight is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, as well as with example programs that can be executed. We make concrete recommendations about prompt structure and generation constraints through ablation experiments, demonstrate state of the art success rates in VirtualHome household tasks, and deploy our method on a physical robot arm for tabletop tasks.

Open-vocabulary Queryable Scene Representations for Real World Planning,"Boyuan Chen, Fei Xia, Brian Ichter, Kanishka Rao, Keerthana Gopalakrishnan, Michael S. Ryoo, Austin Stone, Daniel Kappler",2022-09-20,"Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked new capabilities of task planning from human instructions. However, prior attempts to apply LLMs to real-world robotic tasks are limited by the lack of grounding in the surrounding scene. In this paper, we develop NLMap, an open-vocabulary and queryable scene representation to address this problem. NLMap serves as a framework to gather and integrate contextual information into LLM planners, allowing them to see and query available objects in the scene before generating a context-conditioned plan. NLMap first establishes a natural language queryable scene representation with Visual Language models (VLMs). An LLM based object proposal module parses instructions and proposes involved objects to query the scene representation for object availability and location. An LLM planner then plans with such information about the scene. NLMap allows robots to operate without a fixed list of objects nor executable options, enabling real robot operation unachievable by previous methods.

On Grounded Planning for Embodied Tasks with Language Models,"Bill Yuchen Lin, Chengsong Huang, Qian Liu, Wenda Gu, Sam Sommerer, Xiang Ren",2022-08-29,"Language models (LMs) have demonstrated their capability in possessing commonsense knowledge of the physical world, a crucial aspect of performing tasks in everyday life. However, it remains unclear **whether LMs have the capacity to generate grounded, executable plans for embodied tasks.** This is a challenging task as LMs lack the ability to perceive the environment through vision and feedback from the physical environment. In this paper, we address this important research question and present the first investigation into the topic. Our novel problem formulation, named **G-PlanET**, inputs a high-level goal and a data table about objects in a specific environment, and then outputs a step-by-step actionable plan for a robotic agent to follow. To facilitate the study, we establish an **evaluation protocol** and design a dedicated metric to assess the quality of the plans. Our experiments demonstrate that the use of tables for encoding the environment and an iterative decoding strategy can significantly enhance the LMs' ability in grounded planning. Our analysis also reveals interesting and non-trivial findings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00465v3
JARVIS: A Neuro-Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning Framework for Conversational Embodied Agents,"Kaizhi Zheng, Kaiwen Zhou, Jing Gu, Yue Fan, Jialu Wang, Zonglin Di, Xuehai He, Xin Eric Wang",2022-08-28,"Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain. To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings.

Churpek, Majid Afshar",2022-08-17,"Automatically summarizing patients' main problems from daily progress notes using natural language processing methods helps to battle against information and cognitive overload in hospital settings and potentially assists providers with computerized diagnostic decision support. Problem list summarization requires a model to understand, abstract, and generate clinical documentation. In this work, we propose a new NLP task that aims to generate a list of problems in a patient's daily care plan using input from the provider's progress notes during hospitalization. We investigate the performance of T5 and BART, two state-of-the-art seq2seq transformer architectures, in solving this problem. We provide a corpus built on top of progress notes from publicly available electronic health record progress notes in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III. T5 and BART are trained on general domain text, and we experiment with a data augmentation method and a domain adaptation pre-training method to increase exposure to medical vocabulary and knowledge. Evaluation methods include ROUGE, BERTScore, cosine similarity on sentence embedding, and F-score on medical concepts. Results show that T5 with domain adaptive pre-training achieves significant performance gains compared to a rule-based system and general domain pre-trained language models, indicating a promising direction for tackling the problem summarization task.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08408v2
Interacting with next-phrase suggestions: How suggestion systems aid and influence the cognitive processes of writing,"Advait Bhat, Saaket Agashe, Niharika Mohile, Parth Oberoi, Ravi Jangir, Anirudha Joshi",2022-08-01,"Writing with next-phrase suggestions powered by large language models is becoming more pervasive by the day. However, research to understand writers' interaction and decision-making processes while engaging with such systems is still emerging. We conducted a qualitative study to shed light on writers' cognitive processes while writing with next-phrase suggestion systems. To do so, we recruited 14 amateur writers to write two reviews each, one without suggestions and one with suggestions. Additionally, we also positively and negatively biased the suggestion system to get a diverse range of instances where writers' opinions and the bias in the language model align or misalign to varying degrees. We found that writers interact with next-phrase suggestions in various complex ways: Writers abstracted and extracted multiple parts of the suggestions and incorporated them within their writing, even when they disagreed with the suggestion as a whole; along with evaluating the suggestions on various criteria. The suggestion system also had various effects on the writing process, such as altering the writer's usual writing plans, leading to higher levels of distraction etc. Based on our qualitative analysis using the cognitive process model of writing by Hayes as a lens, we propose a theoretical model of 'writer-suggestion interaction' for writing with GPT-2 (and causal language models in general) for a movie review writing task, followed by directions for future research and design.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00636v2

These embodied problems require an agent to understand many semantic aspects of the world: the repertoire of skills available, how these skills influence the world, and how changes to the world map back to the language. LLMs planning in embodied environments need to consider not just what skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers that change over time in response to the agent's own choices. In this work, we investigate to what extent LLMs used in such embodied contexts can reason over sources of feedback provided through natural language, without any additional training. We propose that by leveraging environment feedback, LLMs are able to form an inner monologue that allows them to more richly process and plan in robotic control scenarios. We investigate a variety of sources of feedback, such as success detection, scene description, and human interaction. We find that closed-loop language feedback significantly improves high-level instruction completion on three domains, including simulated and real table top rearrangement tasks and long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in a kitchen environment in the real world.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05608v1
PlanBench: An Extensible Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Planning and Reasoning about Change,"Karthik Valmeekam, Matthew Marquez, Alberto Olmo, Sarath Sreedharan, Subbarao Kambhampati",2022-06-21,"Generating plans of action, and reasoning about change have long been considered a core competence of intelligent agents. It is thus no surprise that evaluating the planning and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) has become a hot topic of research. Most claims about LLM planning capabilities are however based on common sense tasks-where it becomes hard to tell whether LLMs are planning or merely retrieving from their vast world knowledge. There is a strong need for systematic and extensible planning benchmarks with sufficient diversity to evaluate whether LLMs have innate planning capabilities. Motivated by this, we propose PlanBench, an extensible benchmark suite based on the kinds of domains used in the automated planning community, especially in the International Planning Competition, to test the capabilities of LLMs in planning or reasoning about actions and change. PlanBench provides sufficient diversity in both the task domains and the specific planning capabilities. Our studies also show that on many critical capabilities-including plan generation-LLM performance falls quite short, even with the SOTA models. PlanBench can thus function as a useful marker of progress of LLMs in planning and reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10498v4
Neuro-Symbolic Procedural Planning with Commonsense Prompting,"Yujie Lu, Weixi Feng, Wanrong Zhu, Wenda Xu, Xin Eric Wang, Miguel Eckstein, William Yang Wang",2022-06-06,"Procedural planning aims to implement complex high-level goals by decomposition into sequential simpler low-level steps. Although procedural planning is a basic skill set for humans in daily life, it remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs) that lack a deep understanding of the cause-effect relations in procedures. Previous methods require manual exemplars to acquire procedural planning knowledge from LLMs in the zero-shot setting. However, such elicited pre-trained knowledge in LLMs induces spurious correlations between goals and steps, which impair the model generalization to unseen tasks. In contrast, this paper proposes a neuro-symbolic procedural PLANner (PLAN) that elicits procedural planning knowledge from the LLMs with commonsense-infused prompting. To mitigate spurious goal-step correlations, we use symbolic program executors on the latent procedural representations to formalize prompts from commonsense knowledge bases as a causal intervention toward the Structural Causal Model. Both automatic and human evaluations on WikiHow and RobotHow show the superiority of PLAN on procedural planning without further training or manual exemplars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02928v6
A Mixture-of-Expert Approach to RL-based Dialogue Management,"Yinlam Chow, Aza Tulepbergenov, Ofir Nachum, MoonKyung Ryu, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Craig Boutilier",2022-05-31,"Despite recent advancements in language models (LMs), their application to dialogue management (DM) problems and ability to carry on rich conversations remain a challenge. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to develop a dialogue agent that avoids being short-sighted (outputting generic utterances) and maximizes overall user satisfaction. Most existing RL approaches to DM train the agent at the word-level, and thus, have to deal with a combinatorially complex action space even for a medium-size vocabulary. As a result, they struggle to produce a successful and engaging dialogue even if they are warm-started with a pre-trained LM. To address this issue, we develop a RL-based DM using a novel mixture of expert language model (MoE-LM) that consists of (i) a LM capable of learning diverse semantics for conversation histories, (ii) a number of {\em specialized} LMs (or experts) capable of generating utterances corresponding to a particular attribute or personality, and (iii) a RL-based DM that performs dialogue planning with the utterances generated by the experts. Our MoE approach provides greater flexibility to generate sensible utterances with different intents and allows RL to focus on conversational-level DM. We compare it with SOTA baselines on open-domain dialogues and demonstrate its effectiveness both in terms of the diversity and sensibility of the generated utterances and the overall DM performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00059v1

Abundant evidence also suggests that language plays a developmental role in structuring our learning. Here, we ask: how much of human-like thinking can be captured by learning statistical patterns in language alone? We first contribute a new challenge benchmark for comparing humans and distributional large language models (LLMs). Our benchmark contains two problem-solving domains (planning and explanation generation) and is designed to require generalization to new, out-of-distribution problems expressed in language. We find that humans are far more robust than LLMs on this benchmark. Next, we propose a hybrid Parse-and-Solve model, which augments distributional LLMs with a structured symbolic reasoning module. We find that this model shows more robust adaptation to out-of-distribution planning problems, demonstrating the promise of hybrid AI models for more human-like reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05718v1
Towards a Progression-Aware Autonomous Dialogue Agent,"Abraham Sanders, Tomek Strzalkowski, Mei Si, Albert Chang, Deepanshu Dey, Jonas Braasch, Dakuo Wang",2022-05-07,"Recent advances in large-scale language modeling and generation have enabled the creation of dialogue agents that exhibit human-like responses in a wide range of conversational scenarios spanning a diverse set of tasks, from general chit-chat to focused goal-oriented discourse. While these agents excel at generating high-quality responses that are relevant to prior context, they suffer from a lack of awareness of the overall direction in which the conversation is headed, and the likelihood of task success inherent therein. Thus, we propose a framework in which dialogue agents can evaluate the progression of a conversation toward or away from desired outcomes, and use this signal to inform planning for subsequent responses. Our framework is composed of three key elements: (1) the notion of a ""global"" dialogue state (GDS) space, (2) a task-specific progression function (PF) computed in terms of a conversation's trajectory through this space, and (3) a planning mechanism based on dialogue rollouts by which an agent may use progression signals to select its next response.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03692v2
Super-Prompting: Utilizing Model-Independent Contextual Data to Reduce Data Annotation Required in Visual Commonsense Tasks,"Navid Rezaei, Marek Z. Reformat",2022-04-25,"Pre-trained language models have shown excellent results in few-shot learning scenarios using in-context learning. Although it is impressive, the size of language models can be prohibitive to make them usable in on-device applications, such as sensors or smartphones. With smaller language models, task-specific data annotation is needed to fine-tune the language model for a specific purpose. However, data annotation can have a substantial financial and time burden for small research groups, startups, and even companies. In this paper, we analyze different prompt-based fine-tuning techniques to improve results on both language and multimodal causal transformer models. To evaluate our results, we use a dataset focusing on visual commonsense reasoning in time. Our results show that by simple model-agnostic prompt-based fine-tuning, comparable results can be reached by only using 35%-40% of the fine-tuning training dataset. The proposed approaches result in significant time and financial savings. As the proposed methods make minimal architectural assumptions, other researchers can use the results in their transformer models with minimal adaptations. We plan to release the source code freely to make it easier for the community to use and contribute to our work.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11922v1

As a result, these models store different forms of commonsense knowledge across different domains. In this work, we show that this diversity is symbiotic, and can be leveraged through Socratic Models (SMs): a modular framework in which multiple pretrained models may be composed zero-shot i.e., via multimodal-informed prompting, to exchange information with each other and capture new multimodal capabilities, without requiring finetuning. With minimal engineering, SMs are not only competitive with state-of-the-art zero-shot image captioning and video-to-text retrieval, but also enable new applications such as (i) answering free-form questions about egocentric video, (ii) engaging in multimodal assistive dialogue with people (e.g., for cooking recipes) by interfacing with external APIs and databases (e.g., web search), and (iii) robot perception and planning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00598v2

Specifically, we first build a novel language model to extract plan traces from texts, and then build a set of constraints to generate action models based on the extracted plan traces.

Integrating AI Planning with Natural Language Processing: A Combination of Explicit and Tacit Knowledge,"Kebing Jin, Hankz Hankui Zhuo",2022-02-15,"Natural language processing (NLP) aims at investigating the interactions between agents and humans, processing and analyzing large amounts of natural language data. Large-scale language models play an important role in current natural language processing. However, the challenges of explainability and complexity come along with the developments of language models. One way is to introduce logical relations and rules into natural language processing models, such as making use of Automated Planning. Automated planning (AI planning) focuses on building symbolic domain models and synthesizing plans to transit initial states to goals based on domain models. Recently, there have been plenty of works related to these two fields, which have the abilities to generate explicit knowledge, e.g., preconditions and effects of action models, and learn from tacit knowledge, e.g., neural models, respectively. Integrating AI planning and natural language processing effectively improves the communication between human and intelligent agents. This paper outlines the commons and relations between AI planning and natural language processing, argues that each of them can effectively impact on the other one by five areas: (1) planning-based text understanding, (2) planning-based natural language processing, (3) planning-based explainability, (4) text-based human-robot interaction, and (5) applications.

We examined the psycho-linguistic differences between Facebook and text messages, and their impact on out-of-domain model performance, using a sample of 120 users who shared both. We found that users use Facebook for sharing experiences (e.g., leisure) and SMS for task-oriented and conversational purposes (e.g., plan confirmations), reflecting the differences in the affordances. To examine the downstream effects of these differences, we used pre-trained Facebook-based language models to estimate age, gender, depression, life satisfaction, and stress on both Facebook and SMS. We found no significant differences in correlations between the estimates and self-reports across 6 of 8 models.

Language Models as Zero-Shot Planners: Extracting Actionable Knowledge for Embodied Agents,"Wenlong Huang, Pieter Abbeel, Deepak Pathak, Igor Mordatch",2022-01-18,"Can world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) be used to act in interactive environments? In this paper, we investigate the possibility of grounding high-level tasks, expressed in natural language (e.g. ""make breakfast""), to a chosen set of actionable steps (e.g. ""open fridge""). While prior work focused on learning from explicit step-by-step examples of how to act, we surprisingly find that if pre-trained LMs are large enough and prompted appropriately, they can effectively decompose high-level tasks into mid-level plans without any further training. However, the plans produced naively by LLMs often cannot map precisely to admissible actions. We propose a procedure that conditions on existing demonstrations and semantically translates the plans to admissible actions. Our evaluation in the recent VirtualHome environment shows that the resulting method substantially improves executability over the LLM baseline. The conducted human evaluation reveals a trade-off between executability and correctness but shows a promising sign towards extracting actionable knowledge from language models.

Improving Predictions of Tail-end Labels using Concatenated BioMed-Transformers for Long Medical Documents,"Vithya Yogarajan, Bernhard Pfahringer, Tony Smith, Jacob Montiel",2021-12-03,"Multi-label learning predicts a subset of labels from a given label set for an unseen instance while considering label correlations. A known challenge with multi-label classification is the long-tailed distribution of labels. Many studies focus on improving the overall predictions of the model and thus do not prioritise tail-end labels. Improving the tail-end label predictions in multi-label classifications of medical text enables the potential to understand patients better and improve care. The knowledge gained by one or more infrequent labels can impact the cause of medical decisions and treatment plans. This research presents variations of concatenated domain-specific language models, including multi-BioMed-Transformers, to achieve two primary goals. First, to improve F1 scores of infrequent labels across multi-label problems, especially with long-tail labels; second, to handle long medical text and multi-sourced electronic health records (EHRs), a challenging task for standard transformers designed to work on short input sequences. A vital contribution of this research is new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results obtained using TransformerXL for predicting medical codes. A variety of experiments are performed on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database.

The results demonstrate strong performance in automatic cloze and swapping evaluations. The human judgments show stories generated with TD-VAE reranking improve on a GPT-2 medium baseline and show comparable performance to a hierarchical LSTM reranking model. Conditioning on the latent vectors proves disappointing and deteriorates performance in human evaluation because it reduces the diversity of generation, and the models don't learn to progress the narrative.

In this paper, we investigate the utility of generalized language models in performing such extractions directly from such texts. Such models have already been shown to be quite effective in multiple translation tasks, and our initial results seem to point to their effectiveness also in the context of plan extractions.

Reinforced Iterative Knowledge Distillation for Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition,"Shining Liang, Ming Gong, Jian Pei, Linjun Shou, Wanli Zuo, Xianglin Zuo, Daxin Jiang",2021-06-01,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental component in many applications, such as Web Search and Voice Assistants. Although deep neural networks greatly improve the performance of NER, due to the requirement of large amounts of training data, deep neural networks can hardly scale out to many languages in an industry setting. To tackle this challenge, cross-lingual NER transfers knowledge from a rich-resource language to languages with low resources through pre-trained multilingual language models. Instead of using training data in target languages, cross-lingual NER has to rely on only training data in source languages, and optionally adds the translated training data derived from source languages. However, the existing cross-lingual NER methods do not make good use of rich unlabeled data in target languages, which is relatively easy to collect in industry applications. To address the opportunities and challenges, in this paper we describe our novel practice in Microsoft to leverage such large amounts of unlabeled data in target languages in real production settings. To effectively extract weak supervision signals from the unlabeled data, we develop a novel approach based on the ideas of semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The empirical study on three benchmark data sets verifies that our approach establishes the new state-of-the-art performance with clear edges. Now, the NER techniques reported in this paper are on their way to become a fundamental component for Web ranking, Entity Pane, Answers Triggering, and Question Answering in the Microsoft Bing search engine.

Dimensions of Commonsense Knowledge,"Filip Ilievski, Alessandro Oltramari, Kaixin Ma, Bin Zhang, Deborah L.

Consequently, many sources that include commonsense knowledge have been designed and constructed over the past decades. Recently, the focus has been on large text-based sources, which facilitate easier integration with neural (language) models and application to textual tasks, typically at the expense of the semantics of the sources and their harmonization. Efforts to consolidate commonsense knowledge have yielded partial success, with no clear path towards a comprehensive solution. We aim to organize these sources around a common set of dimensions of commonsense knowledge. We survey a wide range of popular commonsense sources with a special focus on their relations. We consolidate these relations into 13 knowledge dimensions. This consolidation allows us to unify the separate sources and to compute indications of their coverage, overlap, and gaps with respect to the knowledge dimensions. Moreover, we analyze the impact of each dimension on downstream reasoning tasks that require commonsense knowledge, observing that the temporal and desire/goal dimensions are very beneficial for reasoning on current downstream tasks, while distinctness and lexical knowledge have little impact. These results reveal preferences for some dimensions in current evaluation, and potential neglect of others.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04640v2
Facts2Story: Controlling Text Generation by Key Facts,"Eyal Orbach, Yoav Goldberg",2020-12-08,"Recent advancements in self-attention neural network architectures have raised the bar for open-ended text generation. Yet, while current methods are capable of producing a coherent text which is several hundred words long, attaining control over the content that is being generated -- as well as evaluating it -- are still open questions. We propose a controlled generation task which is based on expanding a sequence of facts, expressed in natural language, into a longer narrative. We introduce human-based evaluation metrics for this task, as well as a method for deriving a large training dataset. We evaluate three methods on this task, based on fine-tuning pre-trained models. We show that while auto-regressive, unidirectional Language Models such as GPT2 produce better fluency, they struggle to adhere to the requested facts. We propose a plan-and-cloze model (using fine-tuned XLNet) which produces competitive fluency while adhering to the requested content.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04332v1
Content Planning for Neural Story Generation with Aristotelian Rescoring,"Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant, Tuhin Chakrabarty, Ralph Weischedel, Nanyun Peng",2020-09-21,"Long-form narrative text generated from large language models manages a fluent impersonation of human writing, but only at the local sentence level, and lacks structure or global cohesion. We posit that many of the problems of story generation can be addressed via high-quality content planning, and present a system that focuses on how to learn good plot structures to guide story generation. We utilize a plot-generation language model along with an ensemble of rescoring models that each implement an aspect of good story-writing as detailed in Aristotle's Poetics. We find that stories written with our more principled plot-structure are both more relevant to a given prompt and higher quality than baselines that do not content plan, or that plan in an unprincipled way.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09870v2

Generating Narrative Text in a Switching Dynamical System,"Noah Weber, Leena Shekhar, Heeyoung Kwon, Niranjan Balasubramanian, Nathanael Chambers",2020-04-08,"Early work on narrative modeling used explicit plans and goals to generate stories, but the language generation itself was restricted and inflexible. Modern methods use language models for more robust generation, but often lack an explicit representation of the scaffolding and dynamics that guide a coherent narrative. This paper introduces a new model that integrates explicit narrative structure with neural language models, formalizing narrative modeling as a Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS). A SLDS is a dynamical system in which the latent dynamics of the system (i.e. how the state vector transforms over time) is controlled by top-level discrete switching variables. The switching variables represent narrative structure (e.g., sentiment or discourse states), while the latent state vector encodes information on the current state of the narrative. This probabilistic formulation allows us to control generation, and can be learned in a semi-supervised fashion using both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we derive a Gibbs sampler for our model that can fill in arbitrary parts of the narrative, guided by the switching variables. Our filled-in (English language) narratives outperform several baselines on both automatic and human evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03762v1
Inorganic Materials Synthesis Planning with Literature-Trained Neural Networks,"Edward Kim, Zach Jensen, Alexander van Grootel, Kevin Huang, Matthew Staib, Sheshera Mysore, Haw-Shiuan Chang, Emma Strubell, Andrew McCallum, Stefanie Jegelka, Elsa Olivetti",2018-12-31,"Leveraging new data sources is a key step in accelerating the pace of materials design and discovery. To complement the strides in synthesis planning driven by historical, experimental, and computed data, we present an automated method for connecting scientific literature to synthesis insights. Starting from natural language text, we apply word embeddings from language models, which are fed into a named entity recognition model, upon which a conditional variational autoencoder is trained to generate syntheses for arbitrary materials. We show the potential of this technique by predicting precursors for two perovskite materials, using only training data published over a decade prior to their first reported syntheses. We demonstrate that the model learns representations of materials corresponding to synthesis-related properties, and that the model's behavior complements existing thermodynamic knowledge. Finally, we apply the model to perform synthesizability screening for proposed novel perovskite compounds.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00032v2
Order-Planning Neural Text Generation From Structured Data,"Lei Sha, Lili Mou, Tianyu Liu, Pascal Poupart, Sujian Li, Baobao Chang, Zhifang Sui",2017-09-01,"Generating texts from structured data (e.g., a table) is important for various natural language processing tasks such as question answering and dialog systems. In recent studies, researchers use neural language models and encoder-decoder frameworks for table-to-text generation. However, these neural network-based approaches do not model the order of contents during text generation. When a human writes a summary based on a given table, he or she would probably consider the content order before wording. In a biography, for example, the nationality of a person is typically mentioned before occupation in a biography. In this paper, we propose an order-planning text generation model to capture the relationship between different fields and use such relationship to make the generated text more fluent and smooth. We conducted experiments on the WikiBio dataset and achieve significantly higher performance than previous methods in terms of BLEU, ROUGE, and NIST scores.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00155v1
Probabilistic State-Dependent Grammars for Plan Recognition,"David V. Pynadath, Michael P. Wellman",2013-01-16,"Techniques for plan recognition under uncertainty require a stochastic model of the plan-generation process. We introduce Probabilistic State-Dependent Grammars (PSDGs) to represent an agent's plan-generation process. The PSDG language model extends probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) by allowing production probabilities to depend on an explicit model of the planning agent's internal and external state. Given a PSDG description of the plan-generation process, we can then use inference algorithms that exploit the particular independence properties of the PSDG language to efficiently answer plan-recognition queries. The combination of the PSDG language model and inference algorithms extends the range of plan-recognition domains for which practical probabilistic inference is possible, as illustrated by applications in traffic monitoring and air combat.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3888v1
On the Prospects of Incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Planning and Scheduling (APS),"Vishal Pallagani, Kaushik Roy, Bharath Muppasani, Francesco Fabiano, Andrea Loreggia, Keerthiram Murugesan, Biplav Srivastava, Francesca Rossi, Lior Horesh, Amit Sheth",2024-01-04,"Automated Planning and Scheduling is among the growing areas in Artificial Intelligence (AI) where mention of LLMs has gained popularity. Based on a comprehensive review of 126 papers, this paper investigates eight categories based on the unique applications of LLMs in addressing various aspects of planning problems: language translation, plan generation, model construction, multi-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool integration, and brain-inspired planning. For each category, we articulate the issues considered and existing gaps. A critical insight resulting from our review is that the true potential of LLMs unfolds when they are integrated with traditional symbolic planners, pointing towards a promising neuro-symbolic approach. This approach effectively combines the generative aspects of LLMs with the precision of classical planning methods. By synthesizing insights from existing literature, we underline the potential of this integration to address complex planning challenges. Our goal is to encourage the ICAPS community to recognize the complementary strengths of LLMs and symbolic planners, advocating for a direction in automated planning that leverages these synergistic capabilities to develop more advanced and intelligent planning systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02500v2
Can LLMs Fix Issues with Reasoning Models? Towards More Likely Models for AI Planning,"Turgay Caglar, Sirine Belhaj, Tathagata Chakraborti, Michael Katz, Sarath Sreedharan",2023-11-22,"This is the first work to look at the application of large language models (LLMs) for the purpose of model space edits in automated planning tasks.

We empirically demonstrate how the performance of an LLM contrasts with combinatorial search (CS) -- an approach that has been traditionally used to solve model space tasks in planning, both with the LLM in the role of a standalone model space reasoner as well as in the role of a statistical signal in concert with the CS approach as part of a two-stage process.

Plansformer: Generating Symbolic Plans using Transformers,"Vishal Pallagani, Bharath Muppasani, Keerthiram Murugesan, Francesca Rossi, Lior Horesh, Biplav Srivastava, Francesco Fabiano, Andrea Loreggia",2022-12-16,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been the subject of active research, significantly advancing the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). From BERT to BLOOM, LLMs have surpassed state-of-the-art results in various natural language tasks such as question answering, summarization, and text generation. Many ongoing efforts focus on understanding LLMs' capabilities, including their knowledge of the world, syntax, and semantics. However, extending the textual prowess of LLMs to symbolic reasoning has been slow and predominantly focused on tackling problems related to the mathematical field. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automated planning - a branch of AI concerned with the realization of action sequences (plans) to achieve a goal, typically executed by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, and unmanned vehicles. We introduce Plansformer; an LLM fine-tuned on planning problems and capable of generating plans with favorable behavior in terms of correctness and length with reduced knowledge-engineering efforts. We also demonstrate the adaptability of Plansformer in solving different planning domains with varying complexities, owing to the transfer learning abilities of LLMs. For one configuration of Plansformer, we achieve ~97% valid plans, out of which ~95% are optimal for Towers of Hanoi - a puzzle-solving domain.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08681v1

A Framework for Neurosymbolic Robot Action Planning using Large Language Models,"Alessio Capitanelli, Fulvio Mastrogiovanni",2023-03-01,"Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy due to its ease of understanding and deployment in robot architectures. However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in real-world, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance in complex planning domains or when frequent re-planning is needed. We present a framework, Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs' response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the output, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of end-to-end, making each action available for execution as soon as it is generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn enables concurrent planning and execution. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted by the research community to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to provide an overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities to build a look-ahead predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000 samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by up to 61.4%",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00438v3
LLM+Reasoning+Planning for supporting incomplete user queries in presence of APIs,"Sudhir Agarwal, Anu Sreepathy, David H. Alonso, Prarit Lamba",2024-05-21,"Recent availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of numerous LLM-based approaches aimed at providing natural language interfaces for various end-user tasks. These end-user tasks in turn can typically be accomplished by orchestrating a given set of APIs. In practice, natural language task requests (user queries) are often incomplete, i.e., they may not contain all the information required by the APIs. While LLMs excel at natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they frequently hallucinate on missing information or struggle with orchestrating the APIs. The key idea behind our proposed approach is to leverage logical reasoning and classical AI planning along with an LLM for accurately answering user queries including identification and gathering of any missing information in these queries. Our approach uses an LLM and ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to translate a user query to a representation in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) via an intermediate representation in ASP. We introduce a special API ""get_info_api"" for gathering missing information. We model all the APIs as PDDL actions in a way that supports dataflow between the APIs. Our approach then uses a classical AI planner to generate an orchestration of API calls (including calls to get_info_api) to answer the user query. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly outperforms a pure LLM based approach by achieving over 95\% success rate in most cases on a dataset containing complete and incomplete single goal and multi-goal queries where the multi-goal queries may or may not require dataflow among the APIs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12433v1
A Survey of Optimization-based Task and Motion Planning: From Classical To Learning Approaches,"Zhigen Zhao, Shuo Cheng, Yan Ding, Ziyi Zhou, Shiqi Zhang, Danfei Xu, Ye Zhao",2024-04-03,"Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning and low-level motion planning to equip robots with the autonomy to effectively reason over long-horizon, dynamic tasks.

Large Language Models as Planning Domain Generators,"James Oswald, Kavitha Srinivas, Harsha Kokel, Junkyu Lee, Michael Katz, Shirin Sohrabi",2024-04-02,"Developing domain models is one of the few remaining places that require manual human labor in AI planning.

Specifically, we introduce a framework for automated evaluation of LLM-generated domains by comparing the sets of plans for domain instances. Finally, we perform an empirical analysis of 7 large language models, including coding and chat models across 9 different planning domains, and under three classes of natural language domain descriptions.
